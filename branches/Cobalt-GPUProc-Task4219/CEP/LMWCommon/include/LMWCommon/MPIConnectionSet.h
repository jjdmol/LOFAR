  // @brief Class to hold a set of MPI connections.

  // This class represents a set of MPI connections. Typically it is used
  // to group connections to workers of a specific type.
  // The main reason for having this class is the ability to check if any
  // connection in the group is ready to receive data (i.e. if the other
  // side of the connection has sent data). This is done using MPI_Probe
  // with the tag of the first connection, so all connections in the group
  // should have the same (and unique) tag.
  //
  // @todo Implement getReadyConnection.

  class MPIConnectionSet: public MWConnectionSet
  {
  public:
    // Define a shared pointer to this object.
    typedef boost::shared_ptr<MPIConnectionSet> ShPtr;

    // Set up a connection set to destinations using MPI.
    MPIConnectionSet();

    virtual ~MPIConnectionSet();

    // Clone the derived object to contain only the connections
    // as indexed in the given vector.
    virtual MWConnectionSet::ShPtr clone(const std::vector<int>&) const;

    // Add a connection to the given rank using the tag.
    // The tag can be used to define the type of destination
    // (e.g. prediffer or solver).
    // It returns the sequence nr of the connection.
    int addConnection (int rank, int tag);

    // Get the number of connections.
    virtual int size() const;

    // Get seqnr of connection that is ready to receive.
    // <0 means no connection ready yet.
    virtual int getReadyConnection();

    // Read the data into the BlobString buffer using the connection
    // with the given sequence nr.
