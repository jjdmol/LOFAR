	  data members are handled in the classes SkyCoord and EarthCoord.

	  reduces code duplication.  * Added resilience and error handling
	  when server has died (temporarily).

	  * Added conversion routines for J2000 to ITRF conversion of sky
	  coordinates. Actual conversion has not yet been implemented.

	  * Added support for different types of SkyCoord (J2000, AZEL, and
	  ITRF) and   EarthCoord (ITRF, WGS84). Modifications are backward
	  compatible, except for   the output of operator<<(), which now
	  also prints the type.    Tests have been extended to cover these
	  different types.

	  AMC client/server is now (almost) complete. The implementation is
	  based on the ER231 enhancements made in package LCS/Transport.

	  * Removed DH_Converter class; added DH_Request and DH_Result
	  classes. It	turned out that we do need separate data holder
	  classes for request and   result.

	  * Removed convenience libraries libamcclient in AMCBase/AMCClient
	  and	libamcserver in AMCImpl/AMCServer. They caused too much
	  trouble during   linking.

	  * Modified both ConverterClient and ConverterServer.

	  * Added class Process that wraps the OS fork() method. Class
	  ConverterProcess   is derived from this base class.

	  * Added several test programs; the most important being
	  tConverterClient and	 tConverterServer. The tConverterServer.run
	  script will try to start both   server and client; the client
	  then requests some conversions from the   server; the output
	  returned by the server is then verified.
