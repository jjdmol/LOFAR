# this class is used so that I can use strong authentication without
# much hassel and easily implement timeouts. As I am only sending a frame or
# two at a time it is not really noticable. This also allows an abstraction layer 
# so that I can later change to raw socets/PVM/ or whatever without a major code
# re-write: in no way is this meant for speed :)

# one thing to note: these differ from real sockets API in one major way. since the server 
# uses popen to initiate a connextion the clients stdin/stdout is mapped as the socket, thus
# once a client sock has been established all prints will also go to the server, thus you could
# really mess up communications by doing this - be carefull if you use them.
