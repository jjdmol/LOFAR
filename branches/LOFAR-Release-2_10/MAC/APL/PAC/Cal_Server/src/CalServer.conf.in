#

# Define how many subbands should be calibrated.
# Normal operation value: 512
# Note: For testing purposes this could be set to 50 e.g. to produce the ACC 
# more often.

# switched off when they were not claimed again.

# For testing purposes, read ACC from file
#
# Set ACCTestEnable to 1 to enable reading from file ACCTestFile
# If ACCTestEnable is set to 0 then the ACC is collected from the RSP hardware.
# If extension is .bin then read file as binary. Extension .txt reads 
# file as Blitz array.

# Calibration is not implemented yet, but for testing purposes it is 
# possible to not run the calibration algorithm but pretend it has run. 
# This will result in zero weights being sent to clients.
# ACMProxy is a subtask that asks the RSPDriver to autocorrelate each second 
# another subband. The task is not used in normal operation.
#
# The default operational values are: DisableCalibration=1, 
# DisableACMProxy=1, WriteACCToFile=0 (see below).
#
# To record station correlation data in files: DisableCalibration=1, 
# DisableACMProxy=0, WriteACCToFile=1 (see below).
#

CalServer.DisableACMProxy=1

# ----- Flags to produce interim data files for debugging -----
#       In normal operation these values should be set to 0

# Write ACC's to file for debugging. 
# Note: DisableCalibration should be 0 to produce this file.
