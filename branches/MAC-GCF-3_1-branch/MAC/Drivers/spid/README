These are the drivers used in the MAC software. These currently consist of 

spid.o : a Simple Parallel (Port) Interrupt Driver kernel module.

The aviary-spid kernel module allows us to connect the distibuted clock
board to the parallel port of a normal pc. This is used to generate a
trigger which is distributed over the connected Twin Input Module
(TIM) boards.
