# We take the following path to start a remote container:
#
#  [container] --SSH--> [host] --SRUN--> [worker node] --DOCKER--> [container]
#
# This path is needed because running SRUN from within the container needs a lot of cluster-specific infra
# (SLURM config files, Munge keys, correct Munge user ID, munged).
#
# Throughout this path, we maintain:
#   * userid, which is set to the user that started the master script container (-u `id -u`)
#   * environment (sudo -p, docker -e K=V, etc)
#   * pseudo-tty to prevent buffering logs (ssh -tt, docker -t)

#
# host -> worker node:       srun ...
#                            (Add -w {host} for systems that do not have a global file system, to force job
#                            execution on the host that contains the data)
#
# worker node -> container:  docker run ...
#                            Starts the container on the worker node, with pretty much the same parameters as the master container:
#
#                            --rm: don't linger resources when the container exits
#                            -u (uid): set the user to run as (the calling user)
#                            -h {host}: set container hostname (for easier debugging) (doesnt work yet, using --net=host instead)
#                            -v /data:/data:  map CEP4's global fs. This includes %(working_directory)s and %(runtime_directory)s so those do not have to be mapped as well.
#
#                            /bin/bash -c
#
#                            Required because the pipeline framework needs some bash functionality in the commands it starts.
