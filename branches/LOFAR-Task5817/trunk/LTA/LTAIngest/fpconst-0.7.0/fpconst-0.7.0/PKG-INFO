Description: Utilities for handling IEEE 754 floating point special values
        
        This python module implements constants and functions for working with
        IEEE754 double-precision special values.  It provides constants for
        Not-a-Number (NaN), Positive Infinity (PosInf), and Negative Infinity
        (NegInf), as well as functions to test for these values.
        
        The code is implemented in pure python by taking advantage of the
        'struct' standard module. Care has been taken to generate proper
        results on both big-endian and little-endian machines. Some efficiency
        could be gained by translating the core routines into C.
        
        See <http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs341/IEEE-754references.html>
        for reference material on the IEEE 754 floating point standard.
