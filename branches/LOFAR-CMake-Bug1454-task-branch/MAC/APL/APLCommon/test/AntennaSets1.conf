# AntennaSet.conf
#
# This file defines subsets of the (physical) antennafields that can be used
# in observations as 'the' antennafield.
#
# Since there are 3 different station layout each subset must be defined for 
# each stationtype (Core, Remote and Europe).
#
# A Subset is defined for specifying for each stationtypes for each RCU which
# input is used.
#
# Allowed values for the RCU input selection are:
#	H : HBA input
#	h : LBH input
#	l : LBL input
#	. : RCU not included
#
# To diminish the typing-work to syntax of an rcu definition is:
#   input-selector ::=  H | h | l | .
#	rcu_definition ::= number input-selector [ number inputselector ...]
#
# E.g. when on a station on all RCUs the HBA input must be used this can be defined as
#      192H  in stead of 192 'H' after each other.
#
# Or when all even RCUs should use LBL and all even RCUs shoud use LBH:
#	   96hl
#
# The total number of assigned RCUs MUST match the total number for each station:
#
# RCU counts	LBA		HBA
# Europe		192		192
# Remote		 96		 96
# Core			 96		 96
#
# Use inner half of the LBAs on Core and Remote
LBA_INNER Europe	192h
LBA_INNER Remote	96h
LBA_INNER Core		96h
#
# Use outer half of the LBAs on Core and Remote
LBA_OUTER Europe	192h
LBA_OUTER Remote	96l
LBA_OUTER Core		96l
#
# Use half of inner and outer LBAs on Core and Remote  [TBC]
LBA_SPARSE Europe	192h
LBA_SPARSE Remote	24llhh
LBA_SPARSE Core		24llhh
#
# Use X dipole of all LBAs
LBA_X	 Europe		96h.
LBA_X 	 Remote		48hl
LBA_X 	 Core		48hl
#
# Use Y dipole of all LBAs
LBA_Y	 Europe		96.h
LBA_Y 	 Remote		48lh
LBA_Y 	 Core		48lh

# Note: On Core stations the Serdes splitter is always on for HBA

# Use 'ear' 0 in Core stations (antennas 0-23)
HBA_ONE Europe		192H
HBA_ONE Remote		96H
HBA_ONE Core		48H48.
#
# Use 'ear' 1 in Core stations (antennas 24-47)
HBA_TWO Europe		192H
HBA_TWO Remote		96H
HBA_TWO Core		48.48H
#
# Use both 'ears' in the Core (microstationmode for EOR)
HBA_BOTH Europe		192H
HBA_BOTH Remote		96H
HBA_BOTH Core		96H
