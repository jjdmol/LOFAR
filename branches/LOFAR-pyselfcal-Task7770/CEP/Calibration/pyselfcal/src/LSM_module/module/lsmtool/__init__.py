def load(fileName, beamMS=None, VOPosition=None, VORadius=None):
    """
    Loads a sky model from a file or VO service and returns a SkyModel object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fileName : str
        Name of input ASCII file from which the sky model is read (must respect
        the makesourcedb format) or name of VO service to query (must be one of
        'WENSS', 'NVSS', or 'GSM'), or dict (single source only)
    beamMS : str, optional
        Measurement set from which the primary beam will be estimated. A
        column of attenuated Stokes I fluxes will be added to the table
    VOPosition : list of floats
        A list specifying a new position as [RA, Dec] in either makesourcedb
        format (e.g., ['12:23:43.21', '+22.34.21.2']) or in degrees (e.g.,
        [123.2312, 23.3422]) for a cone search
    VORadius : float or str, optional
        Radius in degrees (if float) or 'value unit' (if str; e.g.,
        '30 arcsec') for cone search region in degrees

    Returns
    -------
    SkyModel object
        A SkyModel object that stores the sky model and provides methods for
        accessing it.

    Examples
    --------
    Load a sky model from a makesourcedb-formated file::

        >>> import lsmtool
        >>> s = lsmtool.load('sky.model')

    Load a sky model with a beam MS so that apparent fluxes will
    be available (in addition to intrinsic fluxes)::

        >>> s = lsmtool.load('sky.model', 'SB100.MS')

    Load a sky model from the WENSS using all sources within 5 degrees of the
    position RA = 212.8352792, Dec = 52.202644::

        >>> s = lsmtool.load('WENSS', VOPosition=[212.8352792, 52.202644],
            VOradius=5.0)

    Load a sky model from a dictionary defining the source::

        >>> source = {'Name':'src1', 'Type':'POINT', 'Ra':'12:32:10.1',
            'Dec':'23.43.21.21', 'I':2.134}
        >>> s = lsmtool.load(source)
