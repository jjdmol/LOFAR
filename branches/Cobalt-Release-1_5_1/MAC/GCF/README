Precondition:
- a PVSS project is running which is configured for GCF (see DEPENDENCIES)

Applications, which uses GCF/PAL, can place a file named customPrepPVSSDB.ctl in 
install dir of PropertyAgent, which executes the containing CTRL-script at startup.
(see example in MAC/Test/GCF/RTC package).

These are continuous applications, which not end by itself. This can be done by CTRL-C.

If the containing packages must be build for the first time they must be build separate in the following order:
GCFCommon
TM
Protocols
PAL
LogSys
PALlight

Each package should be build with the following commands:
> bootstrap
> cd build/gnu_debug
> ../../lofarconf
> make install check
