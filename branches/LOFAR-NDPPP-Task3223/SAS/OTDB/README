SAS/OTDB package
================

The SAS/OTDB package contains the interface to the 'central' SAS database.
The Observation Tree DataBase supports the storage and retrieval of the
information needed to configure and execute an observation.

There are 4 difference types of Observation Trees that are supported:
 + Virtual Instrument Components
   These are the building blocks that correspond with the programs that
   are build to do an observation.
 + VI template trees
   The templates are used to configure the STRUCTURE of the tree so that is
   is suitable for performing a specific kind of observation (e.g. quasar). 
 + VI schedule trees
   These are the real trees used to configure an observation. The tree
   contains the startup parameters for all programs that should run.
 + Physical Instrument trees.
   A tree containing the values of the physical instrument.

The OTDB interface offers access to the observation information to a width
scale of users:
 + Instrument scientist
 + Operator
 + Scheduler module
 + Monitor And Control module
 + System Health Management module

The User Interface for the Instrument Scientist and the Operator is NOT
in this package, this is build in the SAS/OTB package. 

There are still some classes in the package that are defined already but don't
have an operational contents. The are the classes related to 'events' and 
'actions'. The contents of the classes wiil be developed in a future release
of OTDB.
