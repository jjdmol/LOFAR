# PVSSGateway.conf
#

# The PVSSGateway allows updating of a single element of a dynArray DataPoint. 
# To support this the PVSSGateway temporarely stores the dynArrays in 
# memory and collects the element changes before flushing it to the 
# database again. There are three parameters to control the 
# characteristics of this feature.
# Note: updates of non-dynarray values are always applied immediately 
#       to the database.

# To prevent unlimited need of memory the variables are deleted from 
# memory when no updates are received anymore for a certain amount of 
# time. Default dynArrays are removed after 30 seconds of inactivity.
removalDelay = 30

# A DynArray is not written to the database after each element 
# modification to prevent overloading the database. Default each 
# dynArray is updated to the database once every 5 seconds.
flushInterval = 5

# Max number of elements a dynArray may be expanded to when the 
# element-index of the update request is larger than the dynArray size 
# in the database. Default value 966 (= Cobalt max #subbands (4 bit 
# mode)).
expandSize = 966
