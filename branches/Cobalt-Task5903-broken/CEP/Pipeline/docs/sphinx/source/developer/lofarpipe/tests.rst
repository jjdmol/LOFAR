   :synopsis: Pipeline framework tests.

**********************************
The :mod:`lofarpipe.tests` package
**********************************

Pipeline tests are implemented using Python's `unittest
<http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html>`_ module. Test coverage
throughout the framework is currently sadly lacking. This must be addressed in
future development. Such tests as are available are installed as modules in
the :mod:`lofarpipe.tests` package.
