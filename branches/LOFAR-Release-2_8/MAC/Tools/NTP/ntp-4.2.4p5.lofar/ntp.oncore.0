# ONCORE configuration file
#

#
# MODE 0: Oncore is pre-initialized, don't change anything
# MODE 1: No reset, read position & delays from this file, lock it in
# MODE 2: No reset, site survey for position, delay from this file, lock it in
# MODE 3: Hard reset, read position & delays from this file, lock it in
# MODE 4: Hard reset, site survey for position, delay from this file, lock it in.
#
# If a position (LONG, LAT, HT) is specified in mode 2 or 4, then this is used as
# the initial position, which may speed up the site survey.
#
MODE 4

#
# Geographical position, found by performing a 3D site survey
# (MODE == 4 and POSN3D enabled). When the position has been established set
# MODE to 1 and disable POSN3D. The position that has been determined by the GPS
# in a site survey can be found in the logfile "/var/log/ntpstats/clockstats".

#LAT 52 48.7708; LON  6 23.72420; HT  71.05 m
LAT 0
LON 0
HT  0

#
# The DELAY value can be used to compensate for the length of cable between
# the antenna and the receiver.
#
# DELAY 65 ns # dependent on length of cable between antenna and receiver

#
# "ASSERT" means time the PPS on the rising flank.
# "HARDPPS" tells the kernel to discipline its clock to the PPS signal
#
ASSERT

# 20060202 KJW HARDPPS is not supported by the 2.6 kernel
# HARDPPS

# Mask 20 degrees to get the best satelites
MASK 20

#
# When we have insufficient satelite reception set TRAIM OFF
# otherwise NTP will not receive sufficient timestamps to lock
# to GPS clock.
# 
# 11-10-2006 kjw: field tests show that TRAIM can be used safely in the
# field, therefor the following line is commented out by default
#
# 08-10-2008 reo: In the RedHat 5.2 kernel the TRAIM MUST BE OFF!!!
TRAIM OFF

# Don't enable "POSN3D" because it messes up timing. Only enable this for the
# initial 3D site survey to get a good position. To do a site survey MODE should
# be set to 4.
