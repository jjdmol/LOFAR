	  or Connection::write() returns a Connection::Error.

	  Changed from lofar_PACKAGE to lofar_INTERNAL.

	* src/AMCClient/: ConverterClient.cc, ConverterClient.h: %[ER:
	  231]%

	  Initialize the TH_Socket object in the ConverterClient
	  constructor, so that we can catch a failed connect earlier. We
	  don't want to wait for a failed assert on data we've never read,
	  do we? :-))

2005-05-18 17:12  loose

	* test/: Makefile.am, AMCClient/Makefile.am: %[ER: 231]%

	  We need to export LOFARROOT.	The test program tConverterClient
	  is now built in the AMCServer test directory, because it can only
	  run successfully when the server is also available.

	  Removed convenience libraries libamcclient in AMCBase/AMCClient

	  Oops! Added missing backslash.

2005-04-04 12:07  loose

	* configure.in: %[ER: 214]%

	  Should have removed src/AMCClient/Makefile and
	  src/AMCServer/Makefile from AC_OUTPUT, because the associated
	  Makefile.am were removed.

	  214]%

	  AMC client/server is now (almost) complete. The implementation is
	  based on the ER231 enhancements made in package LCS/Transport.

	  * Removed DH_Converter class; added DH_Request and DH_Result
	  classes. It	turned out that we do need separate data holder
	  classes for request and   result.

	  * Removed convenience libraries libamcclient in AMCBase/AMCClient
	  and	libamcserver in AMCImpl/AMCServer. They caused too much
	  trouble during   linking.

	  * Modified both ConverterClient and ConverterServer.

	  * Added class Process that wraps the OS fork() method. Class
	  ConverterProcess   is derived from this base class.

	  * Added several test programs; the most important being
	  tConverterClient and	 tConverterServer. The tConverterServer.run
	  script will try to start both   server and client; the client
	  then requests some conversions from the   server; the output
	  returned by the server is then verified.

	* test/AMCClient/: tBlobIO.cc, tBlobIO.sh, tConverterCommand.cc,

2005-01-12 18:01  loose

	* test/tTimeCoord.cc: %[ER: 214]%

2005-01-12 18:00  loose

	* src/AMCClient/: DH_Converter.cc, DH_Converter.h: %[ER: 214]%

	  Rewrote most methods, taking advantage of BlobArrays having
	  built-in support for I/O streaming an array of objects.

2005-01-12 17:57  loose

	* src/AMCClient/: ConverterClient.cc, ConverterClient.h: %[ER:

	  vectors.

2005-01-12 17:54  loose

	* src/: TimeCoord.cc, TimeCoord.h: %[ER: 214]%

	  * Added methods for setting the time, where time can be specified
	  as seconds   since 1 Jan 1970 (UTC or local time), or as Modified
	  Julian Day.  * Improved formatting of operator<<().
