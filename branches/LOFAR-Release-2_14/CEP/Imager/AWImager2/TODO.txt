TODO
----

Things that still have to be done (in arbitrary order).

* Code clean-up.
* Proper support for MS with multiple channels / bands (MF in FTMachine).
    - How to determine reference frequencies?
    - LofarATerm needs to correct the A-term for the response at the phase center for each channel.
* Get rid of hardcoded values (oversampling, station diameter, ...).
* Compute only the first and last row of the Mueller matrix when asked for a Stokes I image.
* Ionosphere.
* Facetting.
* Allow a facet to be put at the location of a corrupting source.
* MFS from Sanjay (?)
* Parallelisation
* Make sure convolution functions are not too large
* Use WEIGHT_SPECTRUM
* Support for multiple image channels
* Distributed weighting and gridding (multiple subbands on different nodes)
* Grid PSF and data simultaneously (to reduce data access and conv.func. calculation)
* Get rid of multiple times writing avgpb and spheriod_cut_im for csclean
* Implement (de)gridding on GPU
