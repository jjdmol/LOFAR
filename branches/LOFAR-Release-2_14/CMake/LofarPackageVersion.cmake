# - Generate CMake script to create/update LOFAR package version information.
#
# This script generates a CMake script file UpdatePackageVersion.cmake that is
# used in the custom target <pkg>_PackageVersion to create or update the
# source files Package__Version.h, Package__Version.cc and version<pkg>.cc,
# which provide version information about the current LOFAR package. The
# custom target is considered to be always out-of-date, so that it will be
# rebuilt with each invocation of 'make'. It collects version information from
# the Subversion repository, using 'svn info' and 'svn status'. This is
# information is then used to create or update the files Package__Version.h
# Package__Version.cc and version<pkg>.cc, if necessary.
#
# NOTE: you still have to add these sources manually as argument to
# add_library() or add_executable().
#
# See also UpdatePackageVersion.cmake.in
