# Usage: lofarcvsx option <source>
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# lofarcvsx sets or clears the x-bit of files within the master
# CVS repository. The change history is preserved with BOTH
# the new copy and the deleted original. However, all tags are stripped from
# the new copy. This is done so that (1) history is preserved, (2) old states
# of the system can be retrieved using old tags, and (3) new tags do not
# affect the deleted files.
#
# Option -set sets the x-bit of the given file(s).
# Option -clear clears the x-bit of the given file(s).

#
# Status returns:
#    0:  initialization succeeded
#    1:  initialization error
#

  # The "cvs X" command will be executed on the cvs server.
