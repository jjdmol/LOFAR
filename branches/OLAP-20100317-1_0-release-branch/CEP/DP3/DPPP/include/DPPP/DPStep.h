    // This class defines a step in the DPPP pipeline.
    // It is an abstract class from which all steps should be derived.
    // A few functions can or must be implemented. They are called by
    // the NDPPP program in the following order.
    // <ul>
    //  <li> 'updateAverageInfo' should update itself and/or the AverageInfo
    //       object with the information it has. In that way it is known
    //       in all steps how the data are averaged amd what the shape is.
    //  <li> 'show' can be used to show the attributes.
    //  <li> 'process' is called continously to process the next time slot.
    //        When processed, it should call 'process' of the next step.
    //        When done (i.e. at the end of the input), it should return False.
    //  <li> 'finish' finishes the processing which could mean that 'process'
    //       of the next step has to be called several times. When done,
    //       it should call 'finish' of the next step.
    //  <li> showCounts can be used to show possible counts of flags, etc.
    // </ul>
