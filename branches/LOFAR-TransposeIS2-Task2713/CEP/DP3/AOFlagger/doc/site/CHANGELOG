Version 1.5.0
2011-10-20	André Offringa <of...nga@astro.rug.nl>
  * The main points of this release: Better performance, improved visualization and raw file support.
  * The computational performance has been significantly improved (2x faster) using various optimizations, including rewriting algorithms to use the SSE instruction set.
  * New feature: The time-frequency plots are customizable in various ways (View->Plot properties), and have been polished somewhat.
  * New feature: Export visualizations as vector graphics (SVG, PDF) or bitmap (PNG).
  * New feature: FITS export of image plane.
  * New feature: Logarithmic colour scale (both in TF diagram and Image plane window).
  * New feature: Tool tips in some windows.
  * New feature: Raw files produced for the Transient Key Science project can now be read and written by the tools (format description from P. Zarka).
  * The performance of the indirect reader has been improved (flags are also reordered during write).
  * Added a different interpolation algorithm
  * Menus in the gui have been restructured.
  * New testset simulating sinusoidal RFI.
  * Bugfix: Cairo behaved differently on some platforms, and did not show everything.
  * Change resolution action can now optionally take flags into account.
  * Fixed some issues with UV projection and simulation runs.
  * RFI console now returns a status upon finishing, useful for automated pipelines (suggested by C. Coughlan).
  * Heavy refactoring of visualization code.
  * Better test coverage.

Version 1.4.0
2011-07-22	André Offringa <of...nga@astro.rug.nl>

  * New action: absolute threshold. Useful for experimenting (not to be used otherwise).
  * Speed increase of about 10% due to using a novel linear performing algorithm for the dilation. Algorithm provided by J. van de Gronde (article coming up).
  * Several enhancements to fringe filters (see Offringa et al, 2011, in prep.).
  * Enhanced performance of statistic collecting strategies.
  * Added / enhanced possibility to experiment with spatial filters, thanks to a lot of input from U.-L. Pen.
  * Esthetic changes to the gui by regrouping the menus.
  * msinfo reports somewhat more useful info now.
  * colormapper can now average fits images together and has some other useful features.
  * Bugfix: Converging of sets with lots of RFI did not work correctly. Reported by R. van Weeren and D. Rafferty. Won't work for old strategies(!).
  * Bugfix: Winsorized variance calculation is now more accurate with large amounts of RFI.
  * Bugfix: Since the new actions screen was getting too large, the edit strategy now shows a menu of possible actions. Reported by A. Miskolczi.
  * Bugfix: Removed unused parameters of the time selection action. Reported by P. Serra.
  * Bugfix: Parameter -c removed from rfistrategy, as it did not work. Reported by F. De Gasperin.
  * Several new unit tests to validate flagger steps.
  * Some small fixes everywhere around.

Version 1.3.0
2011-04-26	André Offringa <of...nga@astro.rug.nl>

  * Several esthetic changes to the gui, including rounded values on the axes, a z-axis scale and fixed z-scale
  * Feature to create a graphical map of the antennas in a set
  * Various improvements to collection of statistics, such as time-frequency noise plots
  * Dynamic noise spectra generated by the CollectNoiseAction can be opened and re-flagged in RFI gui.
  * Added several unit tests to test correctness of the more complicated algorithms
  * New action that acts like it resamples the data in a specific way, for testing it side effects.
  * Fringe fitting can be performed on any source now
  * Bugfix: Fix of 1d convolution out-of-bounds error, reported by R. van Nieuwpoort
  * Bugfix: fitting of curve when no data is present
  * Bugfix: Fix of somewhat confusing side effect of the dilation operation when the Equal polarisation setting was removed. Reported by A. Biggs.
  * Bugfix: Fix for bug reported by P. Serra, flagging on Stokes Q in a 2 polarization (XX,YY) set did not work
  * Many other small bugfixes
