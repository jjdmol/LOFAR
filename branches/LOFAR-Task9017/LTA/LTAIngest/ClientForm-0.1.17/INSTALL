ClientForm installation instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 1.5.2 or above is required, and urllib2 is recommended.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the package, run the following command:

 python setup.py build

then (with appropriate permissions)

 python setup.py install


Alternatively, just copy the whole ClientForm.py into your Python
path (eg. unix: /usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages,
Windows: C:\Python21, or C:\Python22\Lib\site-packages).  That's all
that setup.py does.


To run the tests (none of which access the network), run the following
command:

 python test.py

This runs the tests against the source files extracted from the
package.  For help on command line options:

 python test.py --help


If you're using a pre-2.1 version of Python, you'll need to get
unittest.py (from http://pyunit.sourceforge.net) to run the Pyunit
tests.
