LCS/Common: Version 2.2 patch 1, date: 2005/07/18
=================================================

Due to backward compatibility issues with PVSS the declaration of the clog()
math functions for doubles has been excluded from the LOFAR built-in complex
declarations when HAVE_PVSS is defined.


LCS/Common: Version 2.2, date: 2005/06/15
=========================================


The following Enhancement Requests have been implemented
--------------------------------------------------------

ER 220 : Build environment     : Compile on 64 bit machine 

         Code has been modified in order to compiler properly on 64 bit
         machines, like AMD Opterons.

ER 236 : LOFAR SW development  : preparations for Package documentation 

         The documentation of each LOFAR package should be put into a separate
         Doxygen group (or module). This makes the documentation more
         accessible and offers a way to quickly browse to different packages.
         Preparations have been made for several packages, including
         LCS/Common.

ER 247 : Common                : Use builtin complex 

         The GNU compiler suite comes with a builtin complex type. Whenever
         possible this builtin type will be used, because performance almost
         triples compared to the std::complex type.

ER 252 : Build environment     : Add 'limit exec' to runtest.sh

         Some test programs occasionally "hang" waiting for a mutex lock, or
         in a blocking I/O operation. In order to not hamper a (system) build
         these suspicious programs should be killed after a predefined
         run-time. This feature has been added to runtest.sh /
         assay. Currently, it will not work when a .run file is used.


The following Problem Reports have been fixed
---------------------------------------------

PR 100 : LOFAR SW development  : Neither config.h nor lofar_config.h should
                                 be included in header files

         Inclusion of either config.h or lofar_config.h in a distributed
         header file is problematic, because the config files themselves
         cannot be distributed; they contain system specific definitions. It
         is therefore unwise to include either of these files in a header
         file.

         Note: This Problem Report is closely related to Enhancement Request
               ER 229.
