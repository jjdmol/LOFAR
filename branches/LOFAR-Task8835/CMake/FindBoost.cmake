# - A tiny wrapper around the FindBoost.cmake macro that comes with CMake. 
# Its purpose is fourfold:
#  - Set BOOST_ROOT if BOOST_ROOT_DIR is set.
#  - Set Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED according to the value of USE_THREADS.
#  - Remove Boost components that have been disabled explicitly from the
#    Boost_FIND_COMPONENTS list. Raise an error, if the component is
#    required.
#  - Define all-uppercase variables for the following variables: 
#    Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS, Boost_LIBRARIES, and Boost_FOUND.
#  - Set a HAVE_BOOST_<COMPONENT> variable in the cache for each component
#    that was found.
