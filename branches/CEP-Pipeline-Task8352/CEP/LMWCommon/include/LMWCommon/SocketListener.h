  // @brief Class that creates a socket and accepts connections.

  // This class sets up a socket listener. It is used by SocketConnectionSet
  // to accept connection requests from workers.
  //
  // Internally the class uses a shared pointer to a socket object.
  // It means that a copy of a SocketListener object can be made, but that
  // copies share the same underlying socket object.

  class SocketListener
  {
  public:
    // Set up the server side of a listener.
    explicit SocketListener (const std::string& port);

    // Listen to a connection and accept it.
    // It blocks until another process wants to connect.
    SocketConnection::ShPtr accept();
