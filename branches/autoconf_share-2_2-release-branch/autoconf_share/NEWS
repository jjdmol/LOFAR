autoconf_share: Version 2.2, date: 2005/06/16
=============================================


The following Enhancement Requests have been implemented
--------------------------------------------------------

ER  70 : autoconf_share         : Track external dependencies 

         Several improvements to rub. E.g., rub can now do a system build
         exactly like the "old" global Makefile. Added a couple of switches.
         Added extensive online help.

ER 220 : Build environment      : Compile on 64 bit machine 

         Variants files for two Itanium systems have been added

ER 236 : LOFAR SW development   : preparations for Package documentation

         The `dot' utility is now used by default for Doxygen, producing much
         nicer diagrams.

ER 248 : Build environment      : Support SSE instructions 

         Use SSE2 instructions whenever possible.

ER 252 : Build environment      : Add 'limit exec' to runtest.sh 

         Added a `limit exec' functionality to assay and
         runtest.sh. Implemented limitexec.sh, a "poor man's" LimitExec, that
         will be used as a fallback. Currently, .run are not started under
         `limit exec' supervision.

ER 275 : Build environment      : XLC variants 

         Added support for Blue Gene cross compiler.
