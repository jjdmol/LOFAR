These are the drivers used in the MAC software. These currently consist of 

spid.o : a Simple Parallel (Port) Interrupt Driver kernel module.

The mac-spid kernel module allows us subscribe on the clock pulse per second
from the clock board. The class GCFDevicePort enables the possibility to
open this device and receive the clock pulse with a GCF internal F_DATAIN signal.

For test purpose you can write a string to the device /dev/spid0 to simulate a clock pulse.
If the string starts with a 'S' an interrupt of the clock board will be simulated. Otherwise
an interrupt will be forced in any case.

After receiving the F_DATAIN signal you must call the recv method on the port to flush the interrupt.
The size of the passed char array must be more or equal than 1 and will be filled with the number of 
received interrupts in the driver sinds the last recv.
