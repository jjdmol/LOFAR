MAC/APL/PAC/ITRFBeamServer/src/BeamServer.cc
Logging of 'current pointing' now at level INFO iso DEBUG


MAC/APL/CASATools/src/CasaConverter.cc
Added support for some other coordinatesystems. The supported systems are now:
APP AZELGEO B1950 COMET ECLIPTIC GALACTIC HADEC ICRS ITRF J2000 JUPITER MARS 
MERCURY MOON NEPTUNE PLUTO SATURN SUN TOPO URANUS VENUS


MAC/APL/PIC/RSP_Protocol/src/RSPFE_Protocol.prot
Removed obsolete protocol


MAC/APL/MainCU/src/ObservationControl/ObservationControl.cc
The ObservationController now sends the 'reached required state' message to the MACScheduler
as soon as the first child reaches this state. Although this is not correct it prevents that
an observations is not reported 'active' in SAS when one station fails.
Future solution will be defining and implementing the Quality Measures.


MAC/APL/RTDBCUDaemons/src/SoftwareMonitor.cc
Call to claimManager in PVSS now asks for datapoint with fullname (LOFAR_ObsSW_xxx).
Check for observationID==0 to avoid needless calls to the claimManager.


MAC/APL/MainCU/src/MACScheduler/ObsClaimer.cc
When claimManager from PVSS returns an empty name an error message is generated.


MAC/APL/RTDBCommon/src/ClaimMgrTask.cc
The claimManager will try each claim only once and will not retry it every 3 seconds infinitely.
A request queue was introduced to make it more robust.


MAC/APL/APLCommon/src/swlevel.conf
Added 'u' to the ClockControl control-pattern so that the software monitor logs to LOFAR_PermSW iso LOFAR_ObsSW.


MAC/APL/StationCU/src/ClockControl/ClockControl.cc
Programs terminates silently when less than 2 startup arguments are given. Relates to change above.
