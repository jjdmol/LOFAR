	* src/ConverterImpl.cc, src/ConverterImpl.h, test/Makefile.am,

	  BugID: 196

	  * Added conversion routines for J2000 to ITRF conversion of sky
	  coordinates. Actual conversion has not yet been implemented.

	  * Added support for different types of SkyCoord (J2000, AZEL, and
	  ITRF) and   EarthCoord (ITRF, WGS84). Modifications are backward
	  compatible, except for   the output of operator<<(), which now

	  different types.

	  Merged the tests tConverterImpl and tConverterClient into
	  tConverter. This makes sense, because both programs shared a lot
	  of source code and the output of both programs should always be
	  the same. Whether ConverterImpl or ConverterClient is tested is
	  now determined by the contents of tConverter.in; this file is
	  created by tConverter.sh. The tConverterServer program was
	  promoted to the program `amcserver' and moved into the src

	  Restructured client/server test. Now both tConverterClient and
	  tConverterServer are built in the AMCServer test directory.
	  Although the client can be built using only the AMCBase package,
	  it cannot run successfully without the server, which obviously
	  needs the AMCImpl package. The testname has been modified to

	  AMC client/server is now (almost) complete. The implementation is
	  based on the ER231 enhancements made in package LCS/Transport.

	  * Removed DH_Converter class; added DH_Request and DH_Result
	  classes. It	turned out that we do need separate data holder
	  classes for request and   result.

	  * Removed convenience libraries libamcclient in AMCBase/AMCClient
	  and	libamcserver in AMCImpl/AMCServer. They caused too much

	  * Modified both ConverterClient and ConverterServer.

	  * Added class Process that wraps the OS fork() method. Class
	  ConverterProcess   is derived from this base class.

	  * Added several test programs; the most important being
	  tConverterClient and	 tConverterServer. The tConverterServer.run
	  script will try to start both   server and client; the client
	  then requests some conversions from the   server; the output
	  returned by the server is then verified.
