# 382 : Connection loss to AMCserver can not be detected or acted upon in 
        client

        Whenenver a client temporarily loses connection with the server it
        will try to reconnect once. When it succeeds, processing will continue
        normally. When it fails it will throw an exception.  
        The server will no longer treat connection loss to a client (i.e. a
        client simply hanging up) as an exceptional case; hence it will not
        throw an exception anymore.

# 382 : Connection loss to AMCserver can not be detected or acted upon in

        ConverterClient would throw an AssertError when the server had
        died. This has now been fixed; a ClientError is thrown instead.
