 * This is an abstract class, which provides the possibility to handle 
 * asynchronous PMLlite actions (like load property set) and value changed 
 * indications (after subscription).
 * 
 * A specialisation of this class can be given to the following classes to 
 * handle their responses or the value changed indications in a generic way:
 * GCFRTMyPropertySet, GCFRTMyProperty
 * 
 * All responses or indications (events) will be given in the handleAnswer 
 * method based on the TM::GCFEvent structure. This provides the flexibility to 
 * handle events in a state machine of a task, to skip or to handle in a 
 * different way.
