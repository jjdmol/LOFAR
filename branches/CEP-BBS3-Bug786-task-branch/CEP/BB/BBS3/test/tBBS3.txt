How to use tBBS3
----------------

tBBS3 is the program to perform tBBS3 tests.
It accepts 2 parameters:
 1. Name of the input file containing the BB settings keyvalue-map.
 2. Optional nrIterations (defaults to 1).
nrIterations is added to the keyvalue-map if the map does not contain
that parameter. In this way the same input file can be used with
different nrIterations settings.

Usually the program is not run directly.
The script tBBS3.sh runs all BBS3 tests in succession. Currently 9 are
defined, but more will be added. The test parameters can be shown by:
  head -14 tBBS3.test*[0-9]
Those files contain the keyvalue-map for each test.

tBBS3 assumes that all data files, scripts, etc. can be found.
In the build/variant/test directory one can achieve that by doing:
  ../../../test/tBBS3.init
It creates a tBBS3_tmp directory and makes symlinks in it to the data
files and scripts used. Note that the data files are taken from
/data/PPS3/diepen/BBS3.
Thereafter you should do
  cd tBBS3_tmp
after which you can run tBBS3.sh by
  ./tBBS3.sh [nriter]
default nriter=1.
Each test in the run generates an output file testn.out, where n is
the test number (1,2,...). It contains the settings, the parameter
values after each iteration, and various timings (wall-clock using
John's NSTimer class).

The current tests use AIPS++ tables for the parameter tables.
It should be straightforward to add tests using database tables.


Note you might also need to update and build LCS/Common to get the
NSTimer class and updates to KeyValue.cc.
It uses file prepareBBD2 in the src directory. Unfortunately I have
forgotten to set the correct permissions for it, so you have to do
  chmod 755 src/prepareBBD2
after checking out or updating the code.
