Using: RTPing -brdnr <1|2>
			 RTEcho	-brdnr <1|2>

Note: These exec's are part of a test run of Application1 from MAC/Test/GCF/MAC.
			They thus normaly will be stared automatically. But they also can be started
			by hand.

Precondition:
- The ServiceBroker, PropertAgent and PropertyInterface of GCF are running (part of MAC/GCF)
- be sure mac.log_prop, RTPing.conf and RTEcho.conf are in the ../etc path (near the RTPing/RTEcho exec's)
- If these exec's are started by hand (and thus not by Application1 from MAC/Test/GCF/MAC) 
	load DPType's and DP's before starting them by: PVSS00api -in MAC/Test/GCF/MAC/src/gcftesttypes.dpl -proj <proj>
