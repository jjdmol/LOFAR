  // MPI has the problem that the output of cout is unpredictable.
  // Therefore the output of tMWControl is using a separate output
  // file for each rank.
  // This class makes this possible. The alias MWCOUT can be used for it.
  //
  // Note that everything is static, so no destructor is called.
  // The clear function can be called at the end of the program to
  // delete the internal object, otherwise tools like valgrind will
  // complain about a memory leak.
