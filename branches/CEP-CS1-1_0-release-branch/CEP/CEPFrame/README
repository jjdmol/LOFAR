*** README LOFAR/CEP/CEPFrame ***

The CEPFrame package offers an extensive framework for the construction of 
complex processing networks. 
It further elaborates on the framework functionality offered by the CEP/tinyCEP
library. It adds support for complex processing networks and advanced dynamical
behaviour in communication between the building blocks.
