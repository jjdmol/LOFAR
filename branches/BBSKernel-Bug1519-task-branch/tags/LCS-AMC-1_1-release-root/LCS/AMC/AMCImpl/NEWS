LCS/AMC/AMCImpl: Version 1.0 patch 2, date: 2005/10/10
======================================================

The following BugIDs have been resolved:
---------------------------------------

# 444 : amcserver leaks file descriptors/socket

        In ConverterServer::handleConnections(), the data socket is now
        deleted in the parent process; otherwise the server would sooner or
        later run out of file descriptors.


LCS/AMC/AMCImpl: Version 1.0 patch 1, date: 2005/09/27
======================================================

The following BugIDs have been resolved:
---------------------------------------

# 382 : Connection loss to AMCserver can not be detected or acted upon in
        client.

        ConverterServer would throw an AssertError when the client had
        died. This has now been fixed; a ServerError is thrown instead, which
        is caught in the main event loop.
