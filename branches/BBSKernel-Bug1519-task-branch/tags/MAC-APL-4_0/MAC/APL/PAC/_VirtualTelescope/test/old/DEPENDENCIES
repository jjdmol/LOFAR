Compiler version:
compat-2.96 (special compiler for the RedHat 8.0 distribution; almost the same as 2.95 but extended with STL)
Because the 3.2 is already installed with RedHat 8.0 the gcc and g++ of the compat 
installation must be renamed (to for instance gcc296 and g++296).

EXTERNAL PACKAGES:
PVSS II 2.12.1 (see MAC/GCF)
LCS/Common
MAC/Tools/LofarLogger
MAC/GCF
log4cplus (see LofarLogger)
