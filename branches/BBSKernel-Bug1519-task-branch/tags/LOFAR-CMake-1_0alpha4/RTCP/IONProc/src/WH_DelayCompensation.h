    // Workholder for calculating the delay compensation that must be applied
    // per beam per station. We start by calculating the path length

    // \f$\mathbf{p}_0\f$.

    // The choice of reference station is arbitrary, so we simply choose the
    // first station from the parameter set. From the equation above it is
    // clear that we can reduce the number of dot products if we precalculate
    // the position difference vectors \f$\mathbf{p}_j - \mathbf{p}_0$\f,
    // which we will store in \c itsPositionDiffs.

    // The geometrical delay is easily obtained by dividing the path length
    // difference by the speed of light in vacuum. We don't need to know the
    // speed of light in the atmosphere, because the AZEL directions that
    // we've calculated are valid for vacuum (only!). This is the delay that
    // must be compensated for.
    //
    // The calculated delay compensation must be split into a coarse (whole
    // sample) delay and a fine (subsample) delay.  The coarse delay will be
    // applied in the input section as a true time delay, by shifting the
    // input samples. The fine delay will be applied in the correlator as a
    // phase shift in each frequency channel.
