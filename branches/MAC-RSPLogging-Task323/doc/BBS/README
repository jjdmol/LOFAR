This directory contains LaTeX source documents related to the BlackBoard
Selfcal (BBS) System. 

In order to "compile" these sources you need to add the following directory
paths to your TEX environment variables (assuming that you've checked out
LOFAR in your home directory):

TEXINPUTS     ~/LOFAR/doc/tex/inputs//    # (note the kpathsea style)
BIBINPUTS     ~/LOFAR/doc/tex/bib

C-shell users can source the scripts setenv.csh to define these variables.
