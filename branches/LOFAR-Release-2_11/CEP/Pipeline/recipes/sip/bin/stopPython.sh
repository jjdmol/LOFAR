# This script is called by MAC PythonControl to stop a pipeline.
# Usage:
#
#   stopPython.sh <parsetFile> 
#
# The script will try to kill the process that was started by startPython.sh
# with <parsetFile> as argument. The PID of this process is stored in the file
# /opt/lofar/var/run/pipeline/`basename <parsetFile>`/pid
#
# If the script succeeds, it will remove the PID-file and return a zero exit
# status; otherwise it will return a non-zero exit status.
#
# Exit statuses:
#  -1: incorrect number of arguments supplied
#   0: success; process was successfully killed 
#   1: PID-file does not exist or is unreadable
#   2: failed to send kill signal (no such process, or operation not permitted)
#   3: process did not terminate within timeout period (30 seconds)
#

# Print usage message and exit with an error status.
