Crude, but effective md5sum / adler32 binary. The a32 command calculates 
the adler32 sum of just one file. It does not really do any decent CLI 
argument checking yet, intended just for testing purposes.
The md5a32 binary works just like the regular md5sum binary, but if you
specify a file (or files) as it's argument, it will also display the
adler32 sum (as last argument).
