This package will become the new Real-Time Central Processing (RTCP) package.
It contains the software packages that are responsible for the real-time
processing of %LOFAR data that arrives at the central processor from the
different %LOFAR stations. This can be, e.g., correlation for the Standard
Imaging mode, or beam-forming for the Pulsar mode.
