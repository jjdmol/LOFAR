These two files are a replacement for the classical MonetDB python client.
It is needed for better stability only, no gains on performance.

mapi.py - for version Oct2012 and later.
mapi2.py - for versions older then Oct2012.

Just overwrite corresponding file in /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/monetdb or wherever monetdb-python is installed.
