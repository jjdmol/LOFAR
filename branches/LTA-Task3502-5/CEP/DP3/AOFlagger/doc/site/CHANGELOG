Version 2.1.0
2012-08-12  André Offringa <of...nga@astro.rug.nl>
  * This release adds support for .sdfits files that are used in Parkes data reduction and has various little enhancements. Strategy file format has not changed.
  * New feature: Parkes' sdfits files can now be opened (with help from J. Delhaize) and the AOFlagger seems to be able to flag such observations well
  * New feature: Save flags action can store flags to sdfits files
  * New feature: New spectrum plot options in Rfigui (plot mean or sum of time steps)
  * New feature: binary 'badstations', will use quality statistics to determine bad stations. Meant to be a fast tool for LOFAR data.
  * New feature: allow reading non-standard columns in the gui (requested by R. van Weeren)
  * New feature: new action 'Normalize variance', observations can be normalized by using the quality statistics.
  * Bug fix: Sinc convolution in time direction can now be accomplished with FFT
  * Bug fix: Added many improvements to the aoqplot quality plotting tool, i.e., better error msgs, more plots, bandpass/time correction, less crashes.
  * Bug fix: No longer silently ignoring write errors during reordering -- before this, when writing failed, flag results were wrong without warning.
  * Enhancement: more options for aoquality tool.
  * Bug fix: The uvfits reader did not work any more on WSRT files because of architectural changes in the AOFlagger. Fixed.
  * Bug fix: AOFlagger can now flag data without time stamps (wich allows me to flag data from my personal hobby telescope).
  * Bug fix: Open button now has key accelerator.
  * Bug fix: AOFlagger did not compile on gcc 4.7 (reported by J. Swinbank).
  * Bug fix: Toolbar in the Rfigui will now always show both text and icons
  * Bug fix: Interface changed to allow NDPPP to read the raw data, NDPPP's problems fixed that concerned quality collecting.
  * Performance enhancement: Improved speed of horizontal sumthreshold algorithm with SSE instructions, leading to about 10\% improved speed on overal strategy.
  * Bug fix: fixed bug in previously mentioned new SumThreshold algorithm causing crashes (reported by J. Swinbank), also adding test case to validate result.
  * Performance enhancement: Improved performance of reading meta data of measurement sets.
  * Experimental additions: the frequency filters are now optimized and can be applied on huge (LOFAR) observations.

Version 2.0.1
2012-03-16	André Offringa <of...nga@astro.rug.nl>
  * This release is a quick fix for a bug that caused a strategy read failure on machines with non-standard locales
  * Bug fix: fixing bug causing strategy reader to malfunction with different locales (reported by Arpad Miskolczi)
  * Bug fix: show an error box when a strategy fails to load instead of crashing
  * Bug fix: complex plane plot was still using gnuplot -- now uses the internal plotter.
  * Bug fix: fixed a bug that sometimes caused a crash after having resized the time-frequency diagram.
  * Bug fix: building without gtkmm was not possible, patched by Marcel Loose.

Version 2.0.0
2012-03-08	André Offringa <of...nga@astro.rug.nl>
  * Main points of this release: no longer depence on pdfviewer & gnuplot for drawing plots and new tools for quality analysis. Strategy file format did not change, thus .rfis files from 1.5.0 can be opened without a problem in 2.0.0.
  * New tool: aoqplot, for very quick but superficial analysis of observations (see LOFAR Cookbook for info).
  * New tool: aoquality, for collecting statistics (also see Cookbook).
  * New feature: An internal plot renderer was added, which is used for all plots in the plot menu. The plots are therefore much faster and better integrated within rfigui, and no longer require gnuplot and a pdf viewer.
  * New feature: ticks and text for logarithmic colour scales are visualized in a more esthetically pleasing way.
  * New feature: Text along x,y,z axes of time-frequency plot can be manually set.
  * New feature: log-log distribution plot in rfigui, with various analysis possible (slope calculation, rayleigh fitter).
  * New feature: rfigui will now immediately ask which baseline to load, instead of loading the first baseline (requested by Raymond Oonk).
  * New feature: you can now specify a MS on the commandline with the rfigui: "rfigui <ms>"
  * Bug fix: Baseline name disappeared in bottom status bar when moving mouse over time-frequency plot. Baseline name is now reported when mouse is moved outside time-frequency plot (requested by Raymond Oonk).
  * Bug fix: very large sets were not displayed correctly in the rfigui due to cairo limitations.
  * Bug fix: clicking on statistics button sometimes crashed the gui.
  * Bug fix: Times along x-axis in rfigui were not correct when splitting the data (reported by Raymond Oonk).
  * Performance of dilation algorithm improved (is not used in default strategy).
  * Slight performance improvement of SSE SumThreshold method.
  * New library interface: the statistics collector is used by NDPPP to accumulate statistics during averaging (NDPPP and AOFlagger remain independ though).
