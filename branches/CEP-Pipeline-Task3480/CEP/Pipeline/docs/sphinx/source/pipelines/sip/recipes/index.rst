Standard Imaging Pipeline recipes
=================================

On this page the three toplevel recipes of the LOFAR Automatic Imaging Pipeline
for MSSS type observations.
The Calibrator pipeline creates an instrument model based on a calibration
observation. 
The instrument model, the calibration solution, is applied to the actual measurements 
in the target pipeline. These Measurement sets are then used by the imaging pipeline
to produce, sky images and a list of sources found in this image.
Each of these steps will get more details in each of the chapters
