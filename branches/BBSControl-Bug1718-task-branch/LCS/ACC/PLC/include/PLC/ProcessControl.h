//# Description of class.
// The ProcessControl class defines the command interface that can be used
// to control the processes of an application.
// 
// All functions in this class are abstract and need to be
// implemented on both the client and the server-side. On the client side
// the implementation will only forward the function-call, on the server
// side (= the application process) the real implementation must be done.
