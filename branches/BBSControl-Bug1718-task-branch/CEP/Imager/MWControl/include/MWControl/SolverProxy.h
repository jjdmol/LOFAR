  // @brief Base class for BBSKernel solver behaviour.

  // This class is the base class for BBSKernel solver behaviour.
  // A derived class needs to do the concrete implementation of the
  // virtual BBSProxy functions.
  // By registering the desired concrete class with type name "Solver"
  // in the WorkerFactory, the MW framework will use that class as the
  // solver proxy.
  //
  // In this way it is possible to use a simple test class (which can
  // merely output the command on cout) to check the control flow.
  // This is used by the test program \a tMWControl.

class SolverProxy: public WorkerProxy
  {
  public:
    SolverProxy()
    {}

    virtual ~SolverProxy();

    // Get the work types supported by the proxy (which is solve).
    virtual std::vector<int> getWorkTypes() const;
  };
