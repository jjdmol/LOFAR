# This test aims to determine the bandwith available from the cobalt cluster to
# the locus cluster using iperf. Traffic will be distributed in a way that is
# similar to that being used in operations. The cobalt nodes are pair-wise
# connected to one of four router PC's, which in turn are connected to
# twenty-five locus nodes. So, cbt001..002 and locus001..025 are connected to
# the first router PC; cbt003..004 and locus025..050 to the second; etc.
