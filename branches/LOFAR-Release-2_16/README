LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) Software Repository - README
========================================================

The LOFAR repository contains some of the software packages to operate
the LOFAR radio telescope and process its measurement output.

LOFAR is operated by ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy.
For more information, see http://www.astron.nl/ and http://www.lofar.org/

Source code is available at https://svn.astron.nl/LOFAR
