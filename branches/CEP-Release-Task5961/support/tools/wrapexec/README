			========


wrapexec is a tool to run an existing binary under the control of another program such as
ddd, valgrind, time, etc. for debugging or profiling purposes. This is handy when your program
is execed or forked by an application over which you have no control, meaning you cannot control
how and with what arguments your program is started. In this case wrapexec can make your program
look like it was still the same, but run it under the control of a debugging or profiling tool.

Usage:

To find out what tools you can use run wrapexec without arguments:

	[user@machine test] wrapexec
	Usage: wrapexec /path/to/program_to_wrap <toolname>.
	Example: wrapexec ./mytest ddd
	<toolname> can be one of:
	        ddd
	        strace
	        valgrind
	        time
	        none

To wrap an existing binary such as mytestprogram, do 'wrapexec mytestprogram strace'.
The wrapexec program prevents you from wrapping the same binary twice. In order to wrap
the binary for a different tool you must unwrap it using 'unwrapexec mytestprogram' and
then wrap it with the new tool.

To customize how wrapexec runs your program under the control of the tool you can copy
/etc/wrapexec.cfg (from your installation directory) to $HOME/.wrapexec.cfg. The wrapexec
program will then only read your copy of the configuration file and ignore the standard
system installed configuration file.

I hope this is a useful tool for you.
