*** README LOFAR/MAC/APL ***

This directory contains the MAC Application Layer software.
The APL software consists of several layers:
- GSO - top level applications, interface with SAS
- VIC - Virtual instrument Control layer. Contains the Virtual Instrument CCU processes
- PAC - Partition Control layer. Contains the Logical Device LCU processes as well
        as the BeamServer and Calibration server processes
- PIC - Physical Instrument Control layer. Contains all low level hardware access
        processes such as the RSPDriver and the RegisterAccess application.
 
Executables
-----------
There are several executables:
GSO: MACScheduler:
	MACScheduler
			The MACScheduler process. Interface between MAC and SAS. 
	test/MACScheduleTest
			Test program for the MACScheduler. The optional parameters -s, -u and -c 
			allow for scheduling, updating schedules and cancelling scheduled 
			observations without using SAS
  test/BeamletAllocatorTest
  		Test program for the BeamletAllocator
  test/LogicalSegmentAllocatorTest
  		Test program for the LogicalSegmentAllocator
  test/addVI
  		Upload Observation schedules to the OTDB database

VIC: VirtualInstrument:
	VirtualInstrument
			The Virtual Instrument process. Runs on the CCU(s). Capable of creating
			ObservationVI's, MaintenanceVI's, pointing VI's, VirtualRoute VI's, 
			ArrayOperation VI's and ArrayReceptorGroup VI's
			VirtualInstrument is tested using the VItest.btsw TSE script.
			
PAC: BeamServer:
	BeamServer
			Creates and calculates beams on a station.
	AVTStub
			
	EPATest
			
	SweepTest
			
	BeamServerTest
			
PAC: CalServer:
	CalServer
			
	juggle_acc
			
	CalTest
			
PAC: StationStartDaemon:
	StationStartDaemon
			This process runs on the remote station LCU's and is capable of starting
			the StationOperations, StationReceptorGroup and VirtualTelescope logical 
			devices.
			The LCU_increment2.btsw TSE script is used to test the StationStartDaemon.

PAC: VirtualBackend
	VirtualBackend
			This process runs on the CEPLCU and is capable of creating VirtualBackend
			logical devices.
			The CEPLCU_increment1.btsw TSE script is used to test the VirtualBackend.
			
PIC: MIS
	MACInformationServer
			The mis.btsw TSE script is used to test the MIS.
			
PIC: NodeManager
	NodeManager
			
			
PIC: RegisterAccess
	RegisterAccess
			Interface between the RSPDriver and PVSS. Maps registers of the RSP board
			to PVSS datapoints.
	aratest
			Test program for RegisterAccess. If the commandline parameter -notest is 
			used, then aratest acts as an RSPDriver stub.
	
PIC: RSPCtlFE
	RSPCtlFE
			Interface between the rspctl executable and PVSS. 
			
PIC: RSPDriver
	RSPDriver
			
	Tuner
			
	SetWG
			
	rspctl
			
	EPAStub
			
	RSPTest
