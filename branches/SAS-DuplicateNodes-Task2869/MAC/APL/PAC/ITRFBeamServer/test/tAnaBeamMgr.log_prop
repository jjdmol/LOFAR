# setup the right levels for logging and tracing
#
# Note: In production you don't want to loose any information so a daily rolling-file
#       is used and tracing is switched off.
#       For debugging purposes the daily rolling-file becomes too large so a size-based
#       rolling file is used and tracing is switched on.
# 
# Please do not change the logger lines below, only comment them in or out.

# For PRODUCTION:
# - Select the appropriate log-level for the rootLogger (DEBUG or INFO)
# - Leave the TRC logger on DEBUG,DUMP
# - Comment out the rootLogger and the TRC logger in the TEST section of this file
#log4cplus.rootLogger=DEBUG, DAILYFILE, MACCLP
#log4cplus.logger.TRC=DEBUG, DUMP

# For TESTING:
# - Select the appropriate trace level for the TRC logger
# - Leave the rootLogger on DEBUG, ROLFILE
# - Comment out the rootLogger and the TRC logger in the PRODUCTION section of this file
log4cplus.rootLogger=DEBUG,  STDOUT
log4cplus.logger.TRC=DEBUG


# The next line should always be active.
log4cplus.additivity.TRC=FALSE
