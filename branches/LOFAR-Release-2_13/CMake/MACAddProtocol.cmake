# - Add a MAC protocol source file. 
#  mac_add_protocol(protocol templ_dir)
# Use autogen to generate a C++ header and source file from the protocol
# definition file ${protocol}.prot, using a template in the template directory
# ${templ_dir}.
#
# The generated C++ header file will have an extension '.ph', to distinguish
# it from ordinary header files. Both C++ header and source file will be
# generated in the directory ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}. The header file will
# also be copied to another directory, such that it can be found when
# ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/include/MAC is part of the compiler's include path.
#
# A custom target ${PACKAGE_NAME}-${protocol} will be created. Targets that
# depend on the generated C++ files should add a dependency on this custom
# target to avoid concurrency problems when doing a parallel build.
