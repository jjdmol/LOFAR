==============================================================================

* Define ${PROJECT_NAME}_LINK_LIBRARIES in LofarAddPackage.cmake, which can
  then be used by lofar_add_library() and lofar_add_executable() in 
  LofarMacros.cmake.

* Rename LOFAR_LIBRARIES to something like LOFAR_EXTRA_LIBRARIES, or
  LOFAR_EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES, or LOFAR_EXTRA_LINK_LIBRARIES. This affects
  LofarFindPackage as well as LofarMacros.cmake.

* Define ${PROJECT_NAME}_INCLUDE_PATH_SUFFIX in LofarAddPackage.cmake.
  The user can then override the default value. There will be no need for
  caching anymore (as far as I can see).

* Create a symlink to each header file, instead of each directory containing 
  header files. 
  Advantages: 
  - you must explicitly mention each header file that is part of the
    package's interface.
  - Generated files (like the MAC protocol files) can be put in the 
    $bindir/include directory instead of $bindir/include/MAC directory.
  Disadvantages: 
  - a lot of symlinks.
  This could all be done using a macro like lofar_add_headers(). This macro
  would then create the directory 
  ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/include/${${PROJECT_NAME}_INCLUDE_PATH_SUFFIX}, when the 
  first symlink is created. Another options is to let LofarAddPackage handle
  this, but then a non-default include path suffix should be set before
  lofar_add_package() is called.

* SSE flags are not yet passed properly to either GNU or ICC compiler.
  Maybe this should just be done in the variants file when defining the
  different compiler suites and options.

* Python package are not yet part of the CMake build.
