==============================================================================

* Solve the CN and ION build problems for RTCP. These problems arise because
  CN and ION are now defined as variants, whereas they should be defined as
  different compilers.
  However, this only solves part of the problem. A *real* solution is to
  define compilers in separate <compiler-suite>.compiler.conf files. That
  way we can do per-compiler settings, instead of per-host settings, using a
  variants file (see bug #1395).

* Solve the problem of running some (distributed) tests, e.g. ParmDB tests,
  which rely on executables and/or scripts that were built as part of another
  LOFAR package. For (C)Make targets, this can be solved by using the target
  property ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}_LOCATION; this would return, e.g., the location
  of getparsetvalue (in LCS/Common). However, scripts, like startdistproc,
  don't have an associated target (because they don't have to be built). We 
  could solve this by creating a custom target for that (and other) scripts:

    add_custom_target(hello.sh ALL)
    add_custom_command(TARGET hello.sh POST_BUILD COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E
    copy ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/hello.sh ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/hello.sh)

  But this feels rather hacky.

* Define ${PACKAGE_NAME}_LINK_LIBRARIES in LofarPackage.cmake, which can
  then be used by lofar_add_library() and lofar_add_executable() in
  LofarMacros.cmake. This avoids the need to create a "dummy" project library,
  solely to resolve all library dependencies on other packages when linking
  executables. 

* Define ${PACKAGE_NAME}_INCLUDE_PATH_SUFFIX in LofarPackage.cmake.
  The user can then override the default value. There will be no need for
  caching anymore (as far as I can see).

* Add possibility to do svn checkout/update per package, using the package
  dependencies provided by lofar_package() and/or lofar_add_package().
  This will be close to the checkout/update behaviour of `rub'.

* Turn makeversion into a real CMake macro and merge it with
  LofarPackageVersion. Generate the Package__Version.{h,cc} files in the
  binary directory, instead of the source directory.

* Create a symlink to each header file, instead of each directory containing 
  header files. 
  Advantages: 
  - you must explicitly mention each header file that is part of the
    package's interface.
  - Generated files (like the MAC protocol files) can be put in the 
    $bindir/include directory instead of $bindir/include/MAC directory.
  Disadvantages: 
  - a lot of symlinks.
  This could all be done using a macro like lofar_add_headers(). This macro
  would then create the directory 
  ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/include/${${PACKAGE_NAME}_INCLUDE_PATH_SUFFIX}, when the 
  first symlink is created. Another options is to let LofarPackage handle
  this, but then a non-default include path suffix should be set before
  lofar_package() is called.

* SSE flags are not yet passed properly to either GNU or ICC compiler.
  Maybe this should just be done in the variants file when defining the
  different compiler suites and options.
  Is this still needed? SSE is enabled by default on x86_64 platforms.
