# RSP+IP.dat
# 
# File that gives a list of RSP IP addresses for the RSP boards of 
# each station
#
# For the moment this is only filled for foreign stations but it can be 
# expanded for NL stations as well. NL stations have RSP IP addresses 
# that can be logically derived from the station name, so these are not
# provided here.
#
# Foreign stations work each with separate vlan settings, thence the need for 
# this file.
#
# These addresses will be put into the RSPDriver.conf as the paremeters
# RSPDriver.LANE_0x_SRCIP, with x between 0 and 3.
