LCS/Blob: Version 1.0, date: 2006/01/31
=======================================

This is the first release of LCS/Blob as a separate package; it used to be
part of the LCS/Common package. For changes to the blob stuff prior to the
split up, please refer to the NEWS and ChangeLog files of the LCS/Common
package.


The following BugIDs have been resolved
---------------------------------------

# 603 : The tBlobStream test fails with an exception: 
        Assertion: valbl[i] == valblc[i]
        DataConvert changed the bit order, so the in_* files were not correct.
        Furthermore tBlobStream has been made a bit more robust.
