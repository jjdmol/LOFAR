<h1>Notes for MFC.</h1>
<p>1. Define DTL_USE_MFC in the MFC project. (But not in the DTL
Lib project which needs to include &lt;windows.h&gt; when building the basic lib
file). This invokes the following logic:
<pre><code>
#ifndef DTL_USE_MFC
	#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#else
	#include &lt;afx.h&gt;
#endif
</pre></code>
<br>
2. In the linker tab of the MFC project tell it to link in the
ODBC libraries and DTL library.  So, e.g., in the debug configuration add the following to the list of files linked in: <br>
odbc32.lib odbccp32.lib C:\dtl_36\lib\Debug\DTL.lib<br>
<br>
3. Make sure that you are using the same C++ runtime library in
your MFC project as is used in building the DTL.lib file. If you
don't do this you will get a bunch of linker errors saying that
various library functions have already been defined.
So, under &quot;C++-&gt;code generation-&gt;use runtime library&quot; if
this is set to &quot;Debug Multithreaded DLL&quot; for the debug
configuration of your MFC project then make sure this same value is
used in the debug configuration for the DTL lib project.<br>
