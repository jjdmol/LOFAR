======================================================

The following BugIDs have been resolved:
---------------------------------------

# 196 : Add support for conversion to ITRF

        Conversion from J200 to ITRF and vice versa has been implemented. Test
        programs have been updated and their output has been verified using
        the AIPS++ Glish script measures.g.

# 382 : Connection loss to AMCserver can not be detected or acted upon in
        client.

        ConverterServer does not throw an exception anymore when a client has
        disconnected, as this is not considered exceptional.



LCS/AMC/AMCImpl: Version 1.0 patch 2, date: 2005/10/10
======================================================

The following BugIDs have been resolved:
---------------------------------------

# 444 : amcserver leaks file descriptors/socket

        In ConverterServer::handleConnections(), the data socket is now
        deleted in the parent process; otherwise the server would sooner or
        later run out of file descriptors.



LCS/AMC/AMCImpl: Version 1.0 patch 1, date: 2005/09/27
======================================================

The following BugIDs have been resolved:
---------------------------------------

# 382 : Connection loss to AMCserver can not be detected or acted upon in
        client.

        ConverterServer would throw an AssertError when the client had
        died. This has now been fixed; a ServerError is thrown instead, which
        is caught in the main event loop.
