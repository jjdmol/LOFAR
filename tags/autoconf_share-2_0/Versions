This file defines all the release versions of software from the LOFAR software tree.
For each release version a separate branch is created. Each version is identified by its
'branch label'. Each branch label has a description to describe what the purpose of the
release is. A list of branch labels is provided for all packages to define which branch
labels apply to which package.

At the end of the file the current branch tree is shown.
