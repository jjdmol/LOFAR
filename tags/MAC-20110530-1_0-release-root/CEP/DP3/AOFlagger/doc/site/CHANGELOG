2011-04-26	André Offringa <of...nga@astro.rug.nl>

  * Several esthetic changes to the gui, including rounded values on the axes, a z-axis scale and fixed z-scale
  * Feature to create a graphical map of the antennas in a set
  * Various improvements to collection of statistics, such as time-frequency noise plots
  * Dynamic noise spectra generated by the CollectNoiseAction can be opened and re-flagged in RFI gui.
  * Added several unit tests to test correctness of the more complicated algorithms
  * New action that acts like it resamples the data in a specific way, for testing it side effects.
  * Fringe fitting can be performed on any source now
  * Bugfix: Fix of 1d convolution out-of-bounds error, reported by R. van Nieuwpoort
  * Bugfix: fitting of curve when no data is present
  * Bugfix: Fix of somewhat confusing side effect of the dilation operation when the Equal polarisation setting was removed. Reported by A. Biggs.
  * Bugfix: Fix for bug reported by P. Serra, flagging on Stokes Q in a 2 polarization (XX,YY) set did not work
  * Many other small bugfixes
