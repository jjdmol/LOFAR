// to transport data between connected BaseDataHolders.
// Actually, the data transport is done between 2 TransportHolder objects
// belonging to the communicating DataHolder objects.
//
// Derived classes (e.g. TH_MPI) implement the concrete transport
// classes.
//
// If data have to be transported between different machines, they
// need to have the same data representation. It is not possible
// yet to transport data between e.g. a SUN and PC. This will be
// improved in the future.
