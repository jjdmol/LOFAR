/**
   This class defines the base class for transport mechanism classes
   to transport data between connected BaseDataHolders.
   Actually, the data transport is done between 2 TransportHolder objects
   belonging to the communicating DataHolder objects.

   Derived classes (e.g. TH_MPI) implement the concrete transport
   classes.

   If data have to be transported between different machines, they
   need to have the same data representation. It is not possible
   yet to transport data between e.g. a SUN and PC. This will be
   improved in the future.
