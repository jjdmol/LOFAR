/**
   This class defines the transport mechanism between data holders
   that have been connected using the TH_Mem_Bl::proto prototype. This can
   only be done when both data holder reside within the same address
   space.  It uses memcpy to transport the data.
  
   The match between send and receive is done using a map.  This map
   keeps track of all messages that have been sent through the
   TH_Mem_Bl::send function. The tag argument is mapped to the private Msg
   class which keeps record fo the address of the buffer that should be
   sent, the number of bytes to send and the tag of the send.

   The blocking behaviour is imposed by using two maps with condition 
   variables. These signal when data is ready to be sent (dataAvailable)
   and when data has been received (dataReceived).
