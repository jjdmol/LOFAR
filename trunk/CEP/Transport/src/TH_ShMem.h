/**
   This class defines the transport mechanism between data holders
   that have been connected using the TH_Mem::proto prototype. This can
   only be done when both data holder reside within the same address
   space.  It uses memcpy to transport the data.
  
   The match between send and receive is done using a map.  This map
   keeps track of all messages that have been sent through the
   TH_Mem::send function. The tag argument is mapped to the private Msg
   class which keeps record fo the address of the buffer that should be
   sent, the number of bytes to send and the tag of the send.  The
   assumption of this implementation is that the tag is unique for
   communication between each pair of connected DataHolders and that
   there is no need to queue multiple sends (i.e. a send will always be
   followed by the matching receive before the next send is done).
