ResultSet:

  * In resultConst() and result(), handle uninitalized results in a more 
  clever way. Perhaps not allow them at all, or return a dummy result?

  * FAILs do not propagate properly? (This may be related to the problem above)
  
  * Add an descriptive error string to the ResultSet when a result is a fail.
    When multiple children fail, concatenate?
  
  * catch exceptions during getResult, return a FAIL
  
  * cdebug() the result differently when WAIT or FAIL is returned

Spigot:

  * Check the situation with test.ms. Be a little less fussy, even with
    technically invalid MSs (in this case, POLARIZATION not filled)
    
  * Verify proper output from test.ms.


Request: 

  * when Jan supplied an illegal request, the error message was not
    exactly descriptive

Vells(DataArray*) constructor: 

  * if rank<2 but nelements==1, reform the array.


General:

  * Check how a zero-length string or hiid array from Glish shows up in
    AppAgent -- because it looked like non-zero when processing child specs.
    
  * Figure out why the hell it freezes on a single-CPU machine sometimes. A
    race condition somewhere?
