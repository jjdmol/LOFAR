    - change Result constructor to take a Cells argument; change it to do
      copy-or-attach (perhaps move this function to CountedRef?)
      
    - add child result caching to Node 

    - Add integrate/sample flag to Result -- not to VellSet
      13/04/04 done

    - Add flag to Cells for equisized cells
      13/04/04 done: included in segment comparison
   
    - Make ResampleMachine
      13/04/04: done
  
    - Modify Resampler
      13/04/04: done
  
    - Handle integrated flag in Compose  
      13/04/04: done

    - Add handling of integrate to leaf nodes 
      Spigot: set          impl 
      Time/Freq: not set   impl
      Const: from config   impl
      Parm: from config?   impl
      13/04/04: done
      
    - Add automatic resampling to Function node; handle integrated flag
      14/04/04: done
      
    - Add ModRes node
      14/04/04: done
      
    - Add capability to recalc the dependency mask on the fly -- must 
      remember the dependency masks then.
      Note that parm should return different masks depending on whether a predict
      or solve is done.
      Propagate dependency handling throughout the system:
      add request modification to nodes that generate new requests
      18/04/04: done, fucking eh!

    - Add debug flag to Node that enables extra sanity checking
      18/04/04: added, not really used yet
      
    - figure out caching of cells in ModRes: comparing rqid is wrong wrong wrong
      18/04/04: actually our own dependMask() is right -- the cached cells
      depend on request only
      
    - All nodes that generate requests (Sink, Solver, ModRes) must send up
      the symdeps that they generate.
      Is there perhaps an easier way to do it?
      19/04/04: yes there is, done: see Node::setGenSymDeps()
      
    - Add Init.Dep.Masks command to MeqServer; change ResolveChildren to a command
      19/04/04: somewhat done, see next item

    - rework this whole pollChildren() business as it is a mess (in ModRes and
      Solver)
      19/04/04: done, it's OK. Have the redefined pollChildren() defer to the
      standard method if the request has no cells.

    - Make sure Solver passes on cell-less requests transparently
      19/04/04: done in pollChildren()

  * Start using the depmask in Node::getCacheResult()
  
  * Possibly use empty Cells to indicate constant values? Propagate these
    properly.
      
  * Work out caching issues with resampled children
  
  * Add Integrator/Differencer node
  
  * Figure out the right value of epsilon for Cells comparisons
  
  * Align glish request_id with new C++ structure
  
  * Add tests for all this crap
  
  * Update the default node defrec.g

  * Look for const_cast in Solver and figure out why it's there!

MEQ in general:

    * Think through some more RequestId issues:
      1) user-defined dependencies ("config" would fall into this category)
      3) dependency on resolution (same domain, different sampling), and
         how this affects caching issues in a multi-res tree
      4) document this!
      OK, here's an idea: the nodes generating new requests are assigned
      dependency masks for the parts of the rqid that they update. 
      These masks are propagated recursively thorugh the tree. For example,
      a Parm knows it depends on VALUE; the mask corresponding to VALUE is
      set by the solver and sent up the tree. This way, parms connected to
      multiple solvers can get their masks right.
    
  * Update documentation! (never goes away, does it?)
    Specifically, a Node construction checklist
  
  * Specify child labels in node constructor; check them in init().
    Process named children properly.
    Re-opening: we want optional children, too (see, e.g., FlagSubtract)
    01/01/04: done, need to test w/glish (glish not working on my laptop)
    16/01/04: tested with default tests; now need to make some nodes
              with child labels
              
        + go through setStateImpl, and clean up usage of getStateField
          31/03/04: done

        + add checkInitState() to recent nodes, setup defaults in state record
          Move children checks to constructior

        + Resolution coupler node
          27/03/04 done: called Resampler
              
        + look through VellSet and Result classes, check for privatize-on-write
          where needed.
          23/03/04: cleaned up
              
        + add shape attribute to VellSet, ensure that Vells, etc. have the same 
          shape (or are scalar)
          19/03/04: done
        
        + How to tell all the nodes to shut up? (stop publishing)
          15/03/04: done, added command to MeqServer
  
        + update add_command to add to command_all list
          16/03/04: done
          
        + meqsink_test() exits when no such MS; it shouldn't
          15/03/04: added try/catch to agent init in MeqServer::run()
  
        + Use the same mechanism to check the request rider as we do for state
          updates. E.g., polc values from the solver should be passed in this 
          manner -- and not via state.
          27/02/04: all done & tested
          
        + reconsider order or events in execute(): should cache be checked
          only after node_state and rider have been processed? Note that for
          repeated requests, this step is skipped, regardless. 
          11/02/04: no, leave as is. 
  
    
        + publish intermediate results

        + Document pollChildren()

        + re-work execute(). Make it possible to send up "empty" (command or
          state-only) requests.  
        + cache failed Results too (along with result_code and such)
        + do processRider()
        + map node_state to setState(), via configuration classes and such.
          Implement and document the two types of lookups.

        + Store nodeindex in node, provide accessor.
        + rearrange init() and setState() to make use of DataRecord::merge().
          12/12/03

        + Rename Result to VellSet and ResultSet to Result
        + Rename getResult() to execute(), and getResultImpl to getResult.
          08/12/03

        + think through writability & privatization issues. Perhaps finally
          implement simple copy-on-write as the default policy in DMI?
          27/11/03: good to go for now. Still thinking about COW.
          
Solver:

  ? BUG: JEN has a problem after Clear.Polcs: execute returns a fail saying
    "no cells in Meq::Request"
    
      [ Apply a gain factor to incremental value updates (perhaps both on the 
        solver side, and on the parm side?) ]
    
        + Implement request ID hierarchy
          28/01/04: done
  
        + Generate a valid RequestId even if the input request is NULL.
          This ties in to hierarchical requests, so maybe something simple for now
          (i.e., append iteration index or something?)
          20/01/04: done for now; revisit with hierarchical requests
          

Flagging:
  
      + add generic flag_mask functionality (a-la MergeFlags) to Function
        23/03/04: done

      + implement ZeroFlagger: flag where value <OP> 0 (OP is ==,!=,<,>,<=,>=)
        23/03/04: done

      + implement MergeFlags: merge flags of all children
        23/03/04: done


Sink/Spigot:

  * improve Spigot flag reading options: e.g., apply mask to input, and
    if true, place result into 1 bit of the output
  
  * handle writing flags in Sink; check if they're written correctly by
    MSOutput
  
        + handle flags in Spigot 
          19/03/04: done
  
        + In deliver, just stick the result in the cache and let the caching code
          take care of everything else. 
          10/01/04: done, needs testing
          20/01/04: seems to work
    
        + Allow string specification for correlations
          09/01/04: no need, now that Spigots output all correlations at once.

Parm:

  * develop different strategies for handling multiple polcs
  
        + for grow_domain: use the envelope domain, rather than checking for 
          strict supersets.
          01/03/04: done

        + rework parm so that predict-only requests may be satisfied without dropping
          the solvable polc (i.e. keep the solvable polc and the per-domain cached
          polcs separate)
          01/03/04: done
  
        + move the update-via-FValue mechanism to the request rider; it doesn't
          really belong in state proper. (The rider needs to be reworked, see 
          entry above).
          25/02/04: done

        + If a polc with the right domain is already specified in the init-record,
          do not read the tables
          11/02/04: done: added inf_domain and grow_domain attributes to a polc
    
        + take over from GvD; log any issues that result
          06/02/04: done
    
        + Figure out how to specify default values (with, e.g., an infinite domain)
          28/01/04: emerged from discussions with JEN

Request: 

  * Buglet: when Jan supplied an illegal request (wrong fields, unmatched IDs), the 
    error message was not exactly descriptive
    
        + BUG: Figure out why state_test() (meqtest.g) causes Requests to be
          fail to unpack upon the first invocation. Possibly related to problem
          below. See details in report 1 below. 14/01/04: found; Cells was
          missing a clone() and thus wouldn't clone itself properly. Request
          would only occasionally be cloned (depending on whether the other
          thread already released the message or not), thus the error only
          showed up when true cloning occurred. Removing bug report from this
          file.

Vells and VellSets and Results:

  * think of extending the Vells math functions: median, etc.

    - double-differencing?
      02/02/04 done for VellSets, needs real testing
    
        + Vells(DataArray*) constructor: if rank<2 but nelements==1, reform the 
          array (otherwise, won't instantiate from scalars!)
          09/02/04: perhaps unnecessary, seeing as we have a meqpolc() glish function?
          16/03/04: stick a fork in it: meqpolc() ensures this
    
        + Problem with in-place operators (+= etc.) and type promotion
          15/01/04 fixed
    
Function:
  
        + Allow cases where a Result has 1 plane and another has N planes: treat
          the single-plane result as a scalar
          12/12/03 done
          
DMI & Debug:

  * ? add protect feature to container fields (for use in classes such as 
    Meq::Result etc.) Note that Hook::replace() does not play well with this.
    (merged with: expose lock()/unlock() of DataRecord fields. Do not lock 
    fields by default. Use locking to "protect" fields, e.g., in the MEQ 
    Request & Result classes.)

  * ? implement CountedRef::makeWritable since this seems to be a very common
    operation
    
  * ? think about recursive makeReadonly: do this on a data structure to make
    sure recepient can't change anything without COW. What to do if we hit
    a readonly branch?
    
  * implement Hook = Hook and Hook <<= Hook, should be easy to do now
  
        + remove flags argument from DataField constructor
          31/03/04: done

        + implement bool Hook::get(T&), for getting stuff by value (or pointer?),
          and simultaneously returning false if not defined.
          31/03/04: done
    
        + In Debug: add capability to redirect the debug message stream
          30/01/04 done

        + Keep thinking about COWs. Perhaps make hooks implicit-COW? This would 
          mean declaring an operator [] on CountedRefs? 
          30/01/04 done
          
        + provide conversions between scalars and single-element arrays
          09/02/04 done & tested

        + DataField: getting a non-existing element as an ObjRef makes the
          element MODIFIED. This can cause confusion later on. Perhaps it
          should only be returned as MODIFIED if write-access is requested?
          apparently fixed 25/01/04
    

OCTOPUSSY:

  * PERF: why does privatizing message arguments in MeqServer
    sometimes lead to cloning? I don't see why anybody else would be holding
    onto the message.
    Update 14/01/04: in fact in a multi-threaded scenario the dispatcher
    is holding onto the message throughout send(). Even if there's only one
    recepient, there's a chance that the recepient thread wakes up, grabs
    the message and starts wastefully cloning it (via a privatize call) 
    because Dispatcher::send() is not yet complete. This ties into the COW
    issue as well; both need to be considered together. As an alternative, 
    perhaps there's a way for send() to block all updated recepients from 
    waking up until the entire send() cycle is complete.

  * BUG: test_octopussy crashes with the NPTL libraries (rh9 system with 2.6 
    kernel, using /lib/tls/ instead of /lib/i686/: try e.g. lofar17, or
    zeppelin at home)
 
  * BUG: valgrind reports thread deadlock on the Dispatcher::startup_cond
    and Dispatcher::repoll_cond condition vars. How is this even possible?
    Perhaps related to problem below?
    
  * BUG: Figure out why the hell it freezes on a single-CPU machine sometimes. A
    race condition somewhere? NB: a sure way to do it (on zeppelin) seems to
    enable wait_reply=T in the Resolve.Children calls in meqtest.g.

  * BUG: Check how a zero-length string or hiid array from Glish shows up in
    AppAgent -- because it looked like a 1-element DataField when 
    processing child specs.
    
  * BUG: Ditto for zero-length arrays ('[]'), i.e., uninitialized domain, etc.

  * Check for USE_THREADS when playing with mutexes (or improve the definition
    of mutexes when compiling without threads: declare constructors for
    Mutex::Lock and all that crap)

General:

  * Fix MeqServer/test/solver_test to run in a "clean" environment
    (i.e. no install, no .glishrc, etc -- mostly related to include paths)
    10/02/04: symlinks to ../pkginc/*.g do part of the job. What do we do
    about *.g files installed in subdirectories though?

        + Bug: MSOutputSink: output to new column doesn't work, column stays
          'dummy'. Ask Ger for help, since I'm obviously misusing tables
          somehow. 20/01/04: not a bug -- it actually works perfectly. It's the
          bloody table browser that's broken!

        + How to use different (gcc-version-specific) libstdc++ versions?
          This can be addressed via LD_LIBRARY_PATH; ideally, we'd like to list
          all gcc/../lib dirs in /etc/ld.so.conf and not worry about it. Can we
          make the binary select the correct library via DT_RUNPATH somehow (see
          the ld.so(1) man page)?
        + solution: pass the following flags to the linker: 
            --enable-new-dtags -rpath /usr/local/gcc-x.y.z/lib/blahblahblah
          This adds an RPATH section to the binary which makes it select the
          correct library.

          merged: * tDataArray segfaults (gcc 3.3.2)
                    14/01/04: ldd was using wrong libstdc++ version.
    
        + test_dmi fails (gcc 3.2.1, 3.3.2)
          14/01/04: fixed, see problem with DataField

        + GlishUtil: interpret record field name "#nnn" as AtomicID(atoi("nnn"))
        + DataField: check how type mismatches are reported; clean up
          12/12/03
        + DataRecord: add a merge method
          8/12/03: done
