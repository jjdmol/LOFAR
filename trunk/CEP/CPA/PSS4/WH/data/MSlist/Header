Header of MSlist columns
------------------------
(MS = Measurement set)

General info
------------
01 - SeqNr = Sequence number of MS
02 - #     = number of subsets.  
             The size of an MS is at most half a GB (because in
             pre-history they were stored on CD). On the other hand,
             most science observations are larger, so the total data
             is separated over multiple MSs. THe name of the MS is
             then <SeqNr>_S0_T<N>.MS, where N is the subset mentioned
             in this column.
03 - Instrument
04 - Object

Frequency info
--------------
05 - #B    = Number of IVC bands use
06 - f     = Centre frquency of observation
             For MSs with 1 band, this is the centre frequency of that
             band. For MSs This is the mean value of the centre
             freuncy of the outermost bands.
07 - df    = Channel width
08 - #CH   = Number of channnels per IVC band
09 - P     = Number of polarizations.
             If 2, only XX and YY are observed, if 4, then also XY and
             YX are observed.
10 - M     = T for a frequency mosaicing, F for a non-mosaic MS. 
             Note that you cannot always judge the mosaicing from the
             number of bands. If $B > 8, then is is for sure a
             mosaicig MS. If #B == 1, then it is for sure not. For 1 <
             #B <= 8, it may be a mosaicing MS.
11 - #F    = Number of observed positions (fields). 
             If this number is > 1, then it is a position mosaicing
             MS.
12 - RA    = Right Ascension
13 - DEC   = Declination
             For a position mosaicng obserations ($F > 1) this is the
             center of the fields calculated as
             RA=(max(RA)+min(RA))/2, DEC=(max(DEC)+min(DEC))/2. Note
             that it is likely that, because of this calcualtion, the
             position RA,DEC itself is not observed.
14 - EX    = Exposure time.
             Note that for mosaicing observations, the first sample of
             new mosaicing points may hav a shorter exposure time.

Date/Time info
--------------
     From
15 - DATE  = Start date
16 - TIME  = Start time
             This is in fact the midtime of the first sample.
     To
17 - DATE  = End date
             Since mosst science measurements are observed during
             night, the end-date is not equal to the start-date
18 - TIME  = End time
19 - DT    = Duration in hh:mm:ss
20 - #Rows = Number of rows in the MS.
             This is the total number of rows, so all subsets
             together.
