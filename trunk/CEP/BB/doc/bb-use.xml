   <para>

    For the LOFAR project a self-calibration program shall be written
    <xref linkend="LOFAR-ASTRON-ADD-006"/>. The idea is that this
    program will have the architectural structure of a
    "BlackBoard". The applicability of this design pattern will be
    investigated and a rapport hereof will be included in this
    document.

 <section>

  <title>the blackboard architectural pattern</title>

  <para>

   The Blackboard pattern as shown in literature has many
   applications. They differ greatly in nature. The main feature of
   each and every one of those is that they work on (parts of) a
   problem by letting pieces of software (knowledge sources) take data
   from a central place (the blackboard), do with it whatever they can
   to get nearer to the solution, and put the results back to that
   central place.

  <title>selfcal requirements</title>

  <para>

   LOFAR is a one-of system. There has never been anything build like
   it. The self-calibration solutions that instrumentalists and
   astronomers are thinking of are not yet developed. Several methods
   to perform a predict-solve step may be created for
   experimentation. Also several high level algorithms may be
   tried. The flexible architecture of the BlackBoard pattern is very
   well suited to insert both new low-level operations (the knowledge
   sources) as well as high level strategies (by configuring the
   controller(s)).

  </para>

  <para>

   It is expected that even in operational state the self-calibration
   will be under development. It might also put different demands on
   different observations. For this a library of control-strategies
   will be convenient.
