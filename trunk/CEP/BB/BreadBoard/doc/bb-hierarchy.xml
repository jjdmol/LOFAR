  <title>Workload distribution</title>
  <para>

   The workload for a self-calibration process, might be distributed
   in several ways. It is a design choice to decide that only
   partitioning to data, as opposed to partitioning to parameters, is
   opportune. This is based on the order of magnitude that the volume
   of data is bigger then the amount of parameters. The data has a
   limited number of dimensions. <note>The number of dimensions is four as far as
   we can tell right now</note> These are.

   The Blackboard will be configured to delegate tasks to children,
   divided along one of these dimensions.<note>It doesn't seem
   necessary to divide along a dimension more then once.</note>

  <title>controllers</title>
  <para>

   A Blackboard has a controller that can be asked to start a process
   for a blackboard. Such a process can be a child-blackboard
   including its controller, or one of the knowledge sources
   associated with the blackboard.
