This module is for prototyping a blackboard system for use by selfcal
engines.

./doc/ contains xml-docbook documents containing some
descriptions of the subject.

./src/ contains the prototype source-code.

Notes:

* postgresql is picky on user connections. this leads to problems
  sometimes. A single connection or a smart connection pool might give
  relief.

* Knowledge source candidates are SelfcalEngine, CentreShifter,
  ThreadController, ThreadWatcher, DataCollector, DataIntegrator.
