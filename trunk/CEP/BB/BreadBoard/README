This module is for prototyping a blackboard system for use by selfcal
engines.

The Directory doc contains xml-docbook documents containing some
descriptions of the subject.

The directory src contains the prototype.

Notes:

* postgresql is picky on user connections. this leads to problems
  sometimes. A single connection or a smart connection pool might give
  relief.

* Knowledge source candidates are SelfcalEngine, CentreShifter,
  ThreadController, ThreadWatcher, DataColector, DataIntegrator.
