  // @brief A WorkerProxy to handle BBSKernel prediffer commands.

  // This class handles the commands the WorkerControl has received.
  // The first command is a call of the \a setInitInfo function.
  // Thereafter \a doProcess is called which reads the message data from
  // the blob and calls the correct BBS Prediffer function.
  //
  // Note that a similar class is made as a test class, which only prints the
  // command. The \a create function registered in the WorkerFactory determines
  // which proxy prediffer object is actually used.

class PredifferBBS: public PredifferProxy
  {
  public:
    // Create this object and its BBS Prediffer object.
    PredifferBBS();

    ~PredifferBBS();

    // Create a new object (to be registered in WorkerFactory).
    static WorkerProxy::ShPtr create();

    // Set the initial Prediffer info.
    virtual void setInitInfo (const ParameterSet&,
			      const std::string& dataPartName);

    // Process the given operation. The associated data is read from the blob.
    // An optional result can be written into the output blob.
    // @todo Currently only one streamId is supported.
    // A map<streamId, Prediffer*> should be used and a new Prediffer
    // created for a new streamId.
