<h2>A strategy example: daylight WSRT observation with strong solar fringes</h2>
<p>Author: Andr&eacute; Offringa, 2011-01-28</p>
<p>
In this example I will try to demonstrate tweaking of some of the parameters
of the default strategy when by itself it does not work
well enough. I will try to flag an WSRT observation
of B1834 with 10 second integration and 512 channels of 5 kHz each.
Below is baseline RT0 x RT1, a 144m baseline.</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A0.png" />
<p>Notice the very strong fringes. I will use this baseline
to experiment on, since it is a good case of RFI, plus the
fringes go from very fast (at the start) to rather slow, so
if the flagger can handle this baseline correctly, others should not
be a problem either.</p>
<p>The strong fringes are due to the sun (the whitish
area before 18:50 after which it evidently sets), and Cas A and Cyg A.
Since the default strategy is LOFAR optimised,
the default flagger does a very bad job by flagging 33% of the data:</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A1.png">
<p>While obviously the sun can be seen as an interfering source, I don't want
to flag it, but rather try to subtract it at a later time.
For this, I will assume you are familair with the RFI GUI
(see the <a href="gui-tutorial.html">GUI tutorial</a>).</p>
<p>Since I want to restart flagging, the first thing I do is remove the
"Or flags with original" action, since otherwise my strategy output will
include the flags of the previous run. If you rerun the strategy, nothing
will be changed yet.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to see what happened to the background fit, to get a
feeling of why it did not work correctly. To see this, I enable the
"Restore from amplitude" button in the "On amplitude" action. This option
only affect how the GUI interprets the results: rerunning the strategy again
will not change anything. However, the Revised background image is now loaded
in the GUI. You can see this by clicking the "Background" toolbar button:
</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A2.png" />
<p>Similarly, the "Difference" button will now show the difference between the
original and the fitted background:</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A3.png" />
<p>One word of caution; when you will now rerun the strategy, it will start
with the already fitted background, i.e., the input of the algorithm is
the differential image, not the original image. Therefore, you'll have to
"reset" your baseline after each run, by reloading it. Alternatively, you
can add a "Set contaminated = original" action as the first action in the
strategy, which will make sure the contaminated (=diff) image is reset
automatically.</p>
<p>You can already see that the background fit did actually remove a lot
of the fringes. There are two visible problems
at this point with the flagging: the
fringes have not been removed completely and the pass-band is too steep.
Remember that you are looking at Stokes I, and that an individual
(cross) polarization might be the actual cause for a certain flag.
</p><p>A common problem is that not enough iterations have been performed,
causing the threshold to drop quickly in each iteration. This might cause
instabilities. To make sure this is not a problem, I enlarge the number
of iterations to "5" and the sensitivity start number of the 
Iterate block to "8". The sensitivity of 8 will make sure that the first
iteration is performed very conservately, and the extra iterations make
sure that we are not leaving out data that has incorrectly been flagged in a
previous run. In all, this will take more time to flag, but at least makes
sure that problems are not due to stability issues. The result is a
slightly smoother background and some improvement in fitting the pass-band, but
the fringes are still flagged:</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A4.png" />
<p>The SumThreshold can be described as an algorithm that tries to find
horizontal
and vertical lines in the image. The fast fringes cause vertical artefacts
in the differential image, hence the SumThreshold method will flag them.
Several approaches can be taken now:</p>
<ul>
<li>The kernel of the background fit can be made smaller.</li>
<li>The sensitivity for broadband-like RFI can be lowered.</li>
<li>The total sensitivity of the SumThreshold method can be lowered.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will show the result of each. Obviously, the best solution can sometimes
be a combination of these options.</p>
<h3>Changing the kernel size of the background fit</h3>
<p>The "kernel size" is a constraint on the
smoothness of the fit. This can be controlled independently for both the time
direction and frequency (resp. horizontal/vertical) direction.</p>
<p>Two actions play a role in the size of kernel width of the background.
The first one is the "Change resolution size" and the second one is the
"Sliding window fit" action. The "change resolution" action is an action
to increase the speed of the flagger. It increases the effect of the sliding
window fit action without much loss of precision. The default strategy
currently has the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change resolution / Time decrease factor: 3</li>
<li>Change resolution / Freq decrease factor: 3</li>
<li>Sliding window fit / Time window size: 10</li>
<li>Sliding window fit / Freq window size: 15</li>
<li>Sliding window fit / Time kernel size: 2.5</li>
<li>Sliding window fit / Freq kernel size: 5.0</li>
</ul>
<p>In our image, the time direction varies more rapidly than the
frequency direction. Therefore, I lower the kernel size in time direction,
by changing "Change resolution / Time decrease factor" to "1".</p>
<p>The result is already a major improvement: (showing the differential image, 12.4% flagged)
</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A5.png" />
<p>The steep pass-band also still causes a problem in the bottom left of
the image. However, even when I decrease the
"Change resolution / Freq decrease factor" to "1", the flags in the bottom
have not been corrected. The sensible thing to do now would be to
divide the image by the (approximate) band-pass, as this is normally well
known. However, for the sake of the exercise, I continue tweaking.
Even when I decrease the kernel size to "1", the problems do not
disappear. I could now disable fitting in frequency direction completely
by setting the frequency window size (on contrast to kernel size) to "1",
but this would make it much harder to find RFI, as frequencies
will no longer be compared. </p>
<p>The root cause of this problem is the "Frequency selection" action. This
action flags outlying frequencies based on their RMS, disallowing the
sliding window fit to use that information. It is meant to allow
faster convergence of the algorithm, but since we already slowed down
the sensitivity convergence, we can safely remove it. This is the result
of removing the Frequency selection action, and leaving the 
"Change resolution / Freq decrease factor" to "3" and leaving the vertical
sliding window fit parameters to their original value: (9.5% of the data is
flagged)</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A6.png" />
<p>The issue with the pass-band has disappeared. This is in most cases
an acceptable result, but not perfect.</p>
<h3>Looking for lines in frequency direction</h3>
<p>Another approach is to modify the threshold settings, to avoid flagging
high values in frequency direction. In a normal situations, broadband RFI
such as lightning or electrical fences can produce these. However,
besides the "fringe"
problem that is faced here, there might be other reasons not to flag in 
frequency direction, for example because one is searching for transients.
This would make us slightly more vulnerable to leaked broad-band RFI, a
trade off that should be considered.</p>
<p>We go back to our default strategy with 5 iterations.
Two actions influence broadband flagging, that is, flagging of vertical
lines in the image. The first action is the SumThreshold, which does the
"per pixel" (yet combinatorial) tresholding. The SumThreshold has an option
named "In frequency direction". By deselecting this option in both SumThreshold
methods (note there are two SumThreshold actions which need to be changed
both!), the result drastically improves: (13% was flagged)</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A7.png" />
<p>Intuitively, this improvement is not so strange; even by eye,
broad-band RFI is almost
impossible to distinguish in this set, unless it is very strong.</p>
<p>At this
point, we have to be careful. Note that this observation lasted twelve hours,
and since we have a 10 second integration, this image represents over 4000
samples. Looking at the full image on a screen is not a good way of
differentiating broadband RFI from false positives due to fringes. For example,
when we zoom in (press "Zoom" in the "View" menu) on the first
two hours of the observation, we see this: (flags have been turned off)</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A8.png" />
<p>This contains broad-band RFI, which was impossible to see in the full image.
For those that are curious about its origin: that often remains a mystery
to me.
Sometimes, lightning causes such effects, but a starting car or even a camera
near the antenna might similarly cause these effects -- but the latter are
unlikely considering their length. The signal is not
dispersed,
so it is unlikely to be a celestial transient. Meteors often only reflect
terrestrial RFI, which is not broadband. The sun
might cause such artefacts, though these lines are also present at the
end of the observation when
the sun is down. In short; we want to flag these lines, because they will
decrease the SNR. Fortunately, even without frequency direction
SumThresholding, these lines are all flagged:</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A9.png" />
<p>The broad-band RFI has been flagged by the two
"Time selection" actions. These actions flag time steps that have an RMS
which differs significantly from its neighbours. If I would remove both
Time selection actions, this is the result:</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A10.png" />
<p>My conclusion would be that the Time selection action was actually doing
a good thing. It lowers the ratio of flags from about 13% to
12.3%, but a large part of this 0.7% is actual unwanted interference.
The conclusion on the frequency direction flagging would be that the 
RMS check should remain, but that SumThresholding in frequency direction
is doing not much good in this set.</p>
<h3>Sensitivity</h3>
<p>Once again I go back to my original strategy with 5 iterations. A last
parameter which is often good for solving issues, is the sensitivity of the
SumThreshold action. I can fix my original very bad result at once by
changing the base threshold of both SumThreshold actions to "2" instead
of its default "1". The result is a good result with 8.5% flags:</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A11.png" />
<p>Note that this both solves most of the flagging problems of sun's fringes
and also solves the bandpass problem. However, also note that the frequency
changing interfering source has a bit more gaps, especially near 17.30 hours
at 138.3 MHz.
While this flagging would be good enough for further reduction, I would prefer
the previous changes and put the sensitivity somewhere in the middle
(by tweaking the end result).</p>
<h3>Summary of modifications</h3>
<p>I have tried to isolate the effect of each important parameter in this
example. Taking all these changes together will enhance the result further.
The summary of changes and conclusions was:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make sure that stability issues are not caused by too few iteration,
I changed the Iteration action to iterate 5 times starting at threshold
factor 8, instead of iterating 2 times starting at threshold factor 4
(see notes below about performance).</li>
<li>Smoothing in time direction was too strong. A good fit in time direction
was achieved by setting the "Change resolution size" to "1".</li>
<li>The bandpass problem could be fixed by removing the "Frequency selection"
action (but removing the bandpass prior to flagging would be better!).</li>
<li>Turning the SumThresholding in the frequency direction off improved
the strategy. Moreover, (even after zooming in) I could not detect
false negatives introduced by this action.</li>
<li>Turning the Time selection off did not significantly lower the false
positives, while some true RFI was left. The time selection action was kept.</li>
<li>Decreasing the sensitivity by increasing the base threshold made the system
more robused, but also introduced a few false negatives. Therefore, I would
suggest a slightly decreased sensitivity, to make sure the strategy never
starts "eating" whole parts of the data (after all,
this is only one baseline, other
baselines might be different). I set the base threshold from its default of
1.0 to a slightly less sensitive 1.2. This decreased the number of flags from 9.6% to 8.4%.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the end result:</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A12.png" />
<p>The fitted background looks like this:</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A13.png" />
<p>Which is a very fair representation of the signal, as can also be seen
from the difference:</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A14.png" />
<p>This image contains almost no artifacts from the signal, except for
a noise increase when the sun is up and during fringes.</p>
<p>A remaining question is how well it works on other baselines. When checking
the other baselines, the parameters work very well on all of them. Consider
RT0 x RT6, which shows other signs of RFI:</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A15.png" />
<p>The 10.1% flags produced by the optimized strategy:</p>
<img src="img/rfi-example-A16.png" />
<h3>Execution on all baselines</h3>
<p>This strategy is ready for execution on all 91 WSRT baselines. This
can be done by (A) pressing the "FOB" button in the strategy window to
encapsulate the strategy in a "For each baseline" action, (B) add a "Write
flags" task as last action inside the "For each baseline" action to actually
write the flags, (C) export the strategy by pressing "Save" and entering a
name and (D) running rficonsole with the saved strategy.</p>
<h3>Performance considerations</h3>
<p>Finally, I would like to note that I increased the number of iterations to
"5" because I wanted to be sure that the background fit would be stable. In
practice, this is not necessary once all parameters are fixed. If you want
to make sure your strategy is also as fast as possible, the number of
iterations can be lowered. In this example, changing the number of iterations
back to "2" and the start sensitivity to "4" does not significantly change
the flags, but is 2x faster.</p>
<p>The "change resolution" action also has a lot of effect on the performance.
Once all parameter optimizations were applied, changing the resolution change
action back did not severely change the accuracy, so if performance would
be an issue, I would revert the change resolution optimization.</p>
<p>Wall-clock time performance on my desktop machine of flagging a 
single baseline:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 iterations: 50 seconds, 8.4% flagged</li>
<li>5 iterations, decreased resolution:
42 seconds, 8.5% flagged</li> 
<li>2 iterations: 26 seconds, 8.4% flagged</li>
<li>2 iterations, decreased resolution:
22 seconds, 8.3% flagged</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, no visible change in accuracy is visible. Note that when
flagging multiple baselines, strategies can be executed multithreaded, so
by using a multi core machine, the total time can be considerably lowered.
Flagging this set on an 8 core machine toke in the order of a few minutes.</p>
