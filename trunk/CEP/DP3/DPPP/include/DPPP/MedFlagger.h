    // This class is a DPStep class flagging data points based on the median
    // of the absolute difference of the data and the median of the data.
    // Both medians are taken in a time/frequency window around the data point.
    // Only unflagged data points in the window are taken into account.
    // The size of the window is given in the parset file.
    // 
    // The window around data points at the edges is formed by mirroring the
    // data at the edge. For example, for channel 0 and a window size of 7
    // the data are mirrored, thus channels 3,2,1,0,1,2,3 will be used.
    // For channel 1 the channels 2,1,0,1,2,3,4 will be used.
    // The test program tMirror.cc can be used to check the correctness of
    // the alogorithm to determine the channels to use.
    //
    // Taking the median is an O(N) operation, thus doing it for all data
    // points is an O(N^2) operation. The test program tMedian.cc can be
    // used to test the performance of the algorithms to determine the median.
    // It shows that casacore's kthLargest outperforms STL's nth_element.
    // <br>
    // Shuffling the data around to be able to determine the medians is also
    // an expensive operation and takes as much time as the medians themselves.
    //
    // When a correlation is flagged, all correlations for that data point
    // are flagged. It is possible to specify which correlations have to be
    // taken into account when flagging. Using, say, only XX may boost
    // performance with a factor 4, but miss points to be flagged.
    // It is also possible to specify the order in which the correlations
    // have to be tested.
