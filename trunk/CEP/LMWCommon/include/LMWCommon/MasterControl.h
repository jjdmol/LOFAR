  // @brief Master control of a distributed process.

  // This class does the overall control of the master/worker framework.
  // It defines the basic operations (see the enum) that can be done by the
  // workers.
  //
  // Its operations are as follows:
  // <ol>
  //  <li> The \a setInitInfo function sends the basic info to all
  //       workers like the name of the VDS to be used.
  //  <li> The \a setWorkDomain function defines the work domain info
  //       in a WorkDomainSpec object.
  //  <li> The processSteps function does the actual processing.
  //       It loops over the entire observation domain in work domain chunks.
  //       For each work domain it loops over the steps to be processed.
  //       This is done by using the MasterControl as a visitor to an MWStep.
  //  <li> After all steps are processed, it sends a quit command to the
  //       workers.
  // </ol>
  // As said above, a step is processed by using the MasterControl as
  // an MWStepVisitor object. Usually step maps directly to an operation
  // and prcoessing the step simply consists of sending a single command
  // to the workers.
  // However, in case of a solve it is more ivolved.
  // It consists of sending multiple operations to localWorkers and globalWorker
  // and testing if the globalWorker has converged. This is all handled in the
  // \a visitSolve function.
  //
  // Instead of using MasterControl as the visitor, it might also be
  // possible to pass a visitor object to the MasterControl. However,
  // apart from processing the steps the MasterControl is doing hardly
  // anything at all, so it might be better to have anther XXXControl
  // class resembling this one.
  // (It might be better to rename MasterControl to BBSControl as it is
  // modeled after the BBSKernel functionality).
