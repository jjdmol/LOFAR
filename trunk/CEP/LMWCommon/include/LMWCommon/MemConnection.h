  // @brief Connection to workers based on memory.

  // This class acts as the MW communication mechanism in memory.
  // It makes it possible to use the MW framework in a single process
  // which makes debugging easier.
  //
  // It is used in the same way as a SocketConnection or MPIConnection, but
  // because everything is synchronous in a single process, a WorkerProxy
  // object must be registered with the connection. Its \a handleData function
  // function is immediately called when data are sent.
  // The result is stored in a buffer in the MemConnection object, which
  // can thereafter be read.
  // After a read the buffer is cleared to ensure it is not read twice
  // (as is also the case in a 'normal' connection).

  class MemConnection: public MWConnection
  {
  public:
    // Define a shared pointer to this object.
    typedef boost::shared_ptr<MemConnection> ShPtr;

    // Set up a connection to the given destination and attach a worker.
    explicit MemConnection (const WorkerProxy::ShPtr& worker);

    virtual ~MemConnection();

    // Get the length of the message.
    // It returns the length of the data in the result buffer.
    virtual int getMessageLength();

    // Receive the data (i.e. the result of a worker from \a itsResult).
    // The \a itsResult buffer is cleared hereafter.
    virtual void receive (void* buf, unsigned size);

    // Write the data and process it by the worker.
    // The result is stored in \a itsResult.
    virtual void write (const LOFAR::BlobString& buf);

  private:
    // This function cannot be called as \a write is implemented.
    virtual void send (const void* buf, unsigned size);
