  // @brief Base class for a step to process a local MW command.

  // This class defines a class that serves as the base class for a
  // local MW step. A local MW step is a step that can be executed
  // directly by a worker without the need of interaction between workers.
  // An example is a subtract or correct. A solve is not a local step,
  // because it requires interaction between workers.

    // Visit the object, so the visitor can process it.
    // The default implementation uses the MWStepVisitor::visitlocal
    // function.
