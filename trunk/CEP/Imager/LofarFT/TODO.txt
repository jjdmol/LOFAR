TODO
----

Things that still have to be done (in arbitrary order).

* Code clean-up.
* Remove unnecessary copy-ing of arrays in LofarConvolutionFunction.
* Proper support for MS with multiple channels / bands (MF in FTMachine).
    - How to determine reference frequencies?
    - LofarATerm needs to correct the A-term for the response at the phase center for each channel.
* Get rid of hardcoded values (oversampling, station diameter, ...).
* Compute only the first and last row of the Mueller matrix when asked for a Stokes I image.
* Ionosphere.
* Facetting.
* Allow a facet to be put at the location of a corrupting source.
* MFS from Sanjay (?)
* Parallelisation
* Gridder optimisation
