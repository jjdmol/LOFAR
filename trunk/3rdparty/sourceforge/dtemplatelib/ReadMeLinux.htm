  <ol>
    <li><font size="2">To compile the Database Template Library you will need 
      gcc 3.0 or gcc 2.96-85 (with patch). You will not be able to compile under 
      gcc 2.95 or gcc 2.96-54 as these versions do not support some C++ standard 
      features that our code requires such as stringstreams. (Actually, we have
      reports from users that you *can* compile under gcc 2.95.4, but you must use the STLport libraries
      which have the necessary parts of the standard library that we need.) </font></li>
    <li><font size="2">The makefiles for Linux are accessed via &quot;sh build.sh&quot; in the 
      lib, example, and tests directories.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">If you compile with gcc 2.96-85 you will get an error message 
      like "basstring.h line 343 cannot convert from const char * to const BYTE 
      * in c_str() return". The problem is that 2.96-85 has a bug in basic_string<CharT>::c_str(). 
      Our recommended fix here is to upgrade to gcc 3.0 where the problem has 
      been fixed. Failing that, it is relatively easy to patch the library, the 
      routine has a statement <font size="4"><strong><code>return "";</code></strong></font>. 
      Simply change this to <font size="4"><strong><code> return (CharT *)"";</code></strong></font> 
      </font></li>
    <li><font size="2"><font size="2">The MySQL ODBC driver version 3.51
              does not work correctly with bulk fetches or the RandomDBView container.
              Current workaround is to enable the DTL_SINGLE_FETCH mode when compiling under Linux.
              This causes the library not to use bulk fetches when reading data into the IndexedDBView containers.
              If you are not using this driver, you may want to remove this flag from the config/linux-i686-gcc.inc file.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2"><font size="2">MySQL 3.23.55 is case sensitive when specifying table names 
              (unlike previous versions of MySQL).  For this reason we have enabled DTL_UC in the linux configuration file
		  config/linux-i686-gcc.inc to force all queries to run in upper case. If you are not running
		  versus MySQL in Linux you may want to remove this flag.
              </font></li>
    <li><font size="2"><font size="2">MySQL 3.23.33 does not support COMMIT or 
      ROLLBACK. Therefore the &quot;range transaction&quot; examples will not 
      work under this version of MySQL.</font></font></li>
    <li><font size="2"><font size="2">When you run the executable for the first 
      time under unixODBC you may get a message like &quot;error while loading 
      shared libraries: libodbc.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such 
      file or directory&quot;. The problem in this case is not having your environment 
      variables set up correctly for unixODBC.<br>

      &gt; Hi,<br>
      &gt; <br>
      &gt; Your problem is not finding the lib at compile time, but at run time,<br>
      &gt; either add /usr/local/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH<br>
      &gt; <br>
      &gt; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib<br>
      &gt; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH<br>
      &gt; <br>
      &gt; (the above assumes linux, if some other OS, it's much the same, mail 
      me<br>
      &gt; if you can't find the variable)<br>
      &gt; <br>
      &gt; Or in linux, as root you can add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf, 
      and<br>
      &gt; then run ldconfig (often in /sbin/ldconfig), to add it to all users 
      lib<br>
      &gt; search paths.</font><font size="2"
