# A tiny wrapper around the FindBoost.cmake macro that comes with CMake. 
# Its purpose is fourfold:
# - Set BOOST_ROOT if BOOST_ROOT_DIR is set.
# - Remove Boost components that have been disabled explicitly from the
#   Boost_FIND_COMPONENTS list. Raise an error, if the component is required.
# - Define all-uppercase variables for the following variables: 
#   Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS, Boost_LIBRARIES, and Boost_FOUND.
# - Set a HAVE_BOOST_<COMPONENT> variable in the cache for each component that
#   was found.

# Set BOOST_ROOT if BOOST_ROOT_DIR is set.
