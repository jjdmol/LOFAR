# - Try to find MASS, the IBM BG/P Mathematical Acceleration Subsystem
# Variables used by this module:
#  MASS_ROOT_DIR     - MASS root directory
# Variables defined by this module:
#  MASS_FOUND        - system has MASS
#  MASS_INCLUDE_DIR  - the MASS include directory (cached)
#  MASS_INCLUDE_DIRS - the MASS include directories
#                      (identical to MASS_INCLUDE_DIR)
#  MASS_LIBRARY      - the scalar math library (cached)
#  MASSV_LIBRARY     - the vector math library (cached)
#  MASS_LIBRARIES    - all MASS libraries
#
# CAUTION: It is not guaranteed that the version of MASS found by this
# macro can be used on the BG/P, because we need to do cross-compilation.
