# - Try to find the Python interpreter, Python header files and libraries. 
# This macro effectively wraps the FindPythonInterp and FindPythonLibs macros
# provided by CMake.
#
# In addition to the variables that are set by FindPythonInterp and
# FindPythonLibs, this will define:
#  PYTHON_FOUND        - system has Python interpreter, Python headers
#                        files and libraries
#  PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS - path to the Python header files
#  PYTHON_BUILD_DIR    - build directory for Python packages (cached)
#  PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR  - installation directory for Python packages (cached)
