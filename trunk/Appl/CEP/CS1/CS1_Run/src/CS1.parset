# This file is built up as follow:
# - Connection data (first all hosts, then all ports, because the hosts need to be changed sometimes, the ports can stay the same)
# - Data format (things like no subbands, station positions
# - Some variables for producing fake data, these will be read by several applications
# - Some general variables (like number of runs)
# - Variables per application. The idea is that these variables are only read by that specific application (if they must be read by more applications, put them in General...)

# The hosts for all (socket)connections
# Do not change these hosts without changing the machinefile(s). Host on which TFC_DelayCompensation runs.
