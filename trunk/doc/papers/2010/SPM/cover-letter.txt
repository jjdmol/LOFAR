by no means did we intend to claim that we developed new memory optimization techniques
or try to "reinvent" them. We simply descrite techniques we used for optimizing
algorithms on many core hardware, and introduce the terminilogy as it is used in the GPGPU
field (e.g. "coalescing"). However, we do agree that it is a very good idea
to provide more context. We added a complete new section ....@@@x

We agree that this is valuable knowledge, and are indeed working on
this for a future paper.

Fixed.

Fixed.

The reviewer is correct. The reason for having more bits it to
mitigate the impact of strong Radio Frequency Interference.
We corrected this in the text.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Fixed, we now correctly introduce the term QS21 blade first.

> Page 8, column 2, reference [4] – all of the words in the title of the
> book except ‘to’ should be capitalized.

Fixed.
