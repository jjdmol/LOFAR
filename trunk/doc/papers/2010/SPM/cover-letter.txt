We are very happy with the positive comments. We were able to address all issues that were identified by the reviewers. 

We now provide context on memory-related optimizations, while referring to the large body of research that was done in this area (Section 5.2.1).

In addition, we added a section on the programmability of the many-core platforms (Section 7).

We also open-sourced the code for the correlator on all platforms. We will make example code available on the web.

Detailed comments are below.

By no means did we intend to claim that we developed new memory optimization techniques, not did we try to reinvent them. Our aim was to simply describe techniques we used for optimizing algorithms on many core hardware, and we introduced the terminology as it is used in the GPGPU field (e.g. "coalescing"). We now clearly state this in the paper.

However, we certainly agree that it is a very good idea to provide more context on memory-related optimizations, and refer to the large body of research that was already done in this area. We added a complete new section, Section 5.2.1 about this.

We agree that this is valuable knowledge, and are indeed working on this for a future paper.

Fixed.

The reviewer is correct. The reason for having more bits it to
mitigate the impact of strong Radio Frequency Interference.
We corrected this in the text.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Fixed, we now correctly introduce the term QS21 blade first.

> Page 8, column 2, reference [4] – all of the words in the title of the
> book except ‘to’ should be capitalized.

Fixed.
