We are very happy with the positive comments of the reviewers.
We were able to address all issues that were identified by the reviewers.

By no means did we intend to claim that we developed new memory
optimization techniques, not did we try to reinvent them. Our aim was to simply
describe techniques we used for optimizing algorithms on many core
hardware, and we introduced the terminilogy as it is used in the GPGPU
field (e.g. "coalescing"). We now clearly state this in the paper.

However, we certainly agree that it is a very good
idea to provide more context on memory-related optimizations, and
refer to the large body of research that was already done in this
area. We added a complete new section, Section 5.2.1 about this.

We agree that this is valuable knowledge, and are indeed working on
this for a future paper.

Fixed.

Fixed.

The reviewer is correct. The reason for having more bits it to
mitigate the impact of strong Radio Frequency Interference.
We corrected this in the text.

> Page 3, column 1, last line – remove ‘of’ to give ‘less
> instructions’.

Fixed.

> Page 4, column 1, 1st line – ‘The most high end’ => ‘The highest
> performance’.

Fixed.

> Page 5, column2, line 8 should read ‘assumes a complete overlap of
> communication and computation’

Fixed.

> Page 5, column 2, near end of 2nd paragraph – should read ‘by
> computing the AI for the full system’

Fixed.

> Page 6, column 1, near end of 6.1 – ‘tile’ is used with no
> explanation. Perhaps put ‘such as the red area in Figure 4’ in
> brackets.

Fixed.

> Page 7, column 2, before and after the 6.3 title the term ‘cell blade’
> and ‘QS21 blade’ are used without any prior explanation.
> Perhaps just mention testing two of the chips together without any
> mention of ‘blade’.

Fixed, we now correctly introduce the term QS21 blade first.

> Page 8, column 2, reference [4] – all of the words in the title of the
> book except ‘to’ should be capitalized.

Fixed.
