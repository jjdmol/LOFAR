GPUProc/{src,test} contain several scripts to start observations.
The call chain is as follows:

      OnlineControl (MAC)
       | |       ^
       V |       |
startBGL.$h -> runObservation.sh -> mpirun.sh -> [mpirun] rtcp
 ^       V      ^     ^
 |  stopBGL.sh -/     |
 |                    |
tstartBGL.sh    tMACfeedback.sh
                tProductionParsets.sh
                testParset.sh

The central thread is the main call chain, with the following roles and responsibilities:

  startBGL.sh:        - starts an observation in the background
                      - adheres to specific parameter order as specified by OnlineControl

  stopBGL.sh:         - signals a running runObservation.sh to finish or abort
                      - adheres <idem>

  runObservation.sh:  - (optionally) augments parset with Cobalt-specific settings
                      - (optionally) copies feedback to MAC after the observation
                      - (optionally) informs OnlineControl after observation finishes
                      - (optionally) creates PID file for stopBGL.sh

  mpirun.sh:          - acts as mpirun, but wraps the currently selected MPI library
                        (OpenMPI, MVAPICH2, no MPI) in a generic way.

  rtcp:               - the actual program that performs the correlation/beamforming
