Modifications made in MAC for CS1
=================================

GCF/GCFCommon
=============
** ParameterSet: changed GCF version of ParameterSet to ACC::APS::ParameterSet.
		Function GCF::Parameterset::instance --> ParameterSetInstance()
		Loosing searchPath functionality in ParameterSet, this can be compensated
		with the new FileLocator classes of LCS/Common.
** GCF_ServiceInfo.h: Created a file containing all servicenames to be used in MAC
		as well the well-known portnumber of any ServiceBroker.

APL/APLCommon
============
** Added messages FINISH and FINISHED to LDprotocol to allow ObsCntlrs to tell
		the MACSchedulers that they are ready.

GCF/TM
======
** GCF_PortInterface: Added functionality for support of instanceNumbers on
		ports. Also introduced 'smart' servicenames that are aware of these
		instanceNumbers.
		Use the function 'setInstanceNr(int)' on ports that need a different 
		instancenumber than 0.
** xxxPortxx: in all xxxPort classes the 'name' parameter in the constructor
		and the 'init' routine changed to const string&.
		Modified the 'logic' behind the search for service names and numbers in
		all kind of configuration files. When using a servicename(see GCFCommon/
		GCF_ServiceInfo.h> for the name of the port the configfiles are ignored
		and the ServiceBroker is used immediately.
** GCF_TimerPort: New porttype for handling timers.
** ServiceBroker: no longer informs clients about gone services.
** GCF_Task: uses LofarLocators for log_prop and conf file.
** GTM_ServiceBroker: does not read ServiceBroker.conf file anymore. Solved major
		bug in unregistering all ports always. (because of another bug in the
		GSB_Controller this never lead to problems).
** GSB_Controller: MAJOR(!) revision of broker after a continuous chain of problems.
		Cut away almost all crap, no support for multiple hosts anymore.


Updated several sources for new ParameterSet.


GCF/PAL
=======
Updated several sources for new ParameterSet.


GCF/PAL/PML
===========
** GPMController: uses LofarLocators for parameterfiles.


GCF/APL/APLCommon
=================
Updated several sources for new ParameterSet.
Added several ; at end of LOG_xxx statements.
Added define LOFAR_SHARE_LOCATION /opt/lofar/share in APL_Defines.h

** LogicalDeviceFactoryBase: replaced by LogicalDeviceStarter class that starts
		a new program in stead of a new task.
** StartDaemon: works with LogicalDeviceStarter iso LogicalDeviceFactoryBase. 
		This depends on the define CREATING_TASKS for now.
** APLUtilities: replaced 'tmpnam' with 'mkstemp' function.
		Added optional argument to getTempFileName


GCF/APL/VIC/VirtualInstrument
=============================
** VirtualInstrumentStartDaemonMain: renamed to CCUStartDaemonMain.
** VirtualInstrument: is now a LogicalDevice program iso the startdaemon.
** MaintenanceVI: is now a LogicalDevice program iso a task
** ObservationVI: is now a LogicalDevice program iso a task

GCF/APL/MainCU/src/MACScheduler
===============================
Complete new implementation of the MACScheduler: It polls the OTDB itself
and only controls ObsControllers.


PROBLEMS TO SOLVE
=================
** BOOST_SP_USE_PTHREADS is now in several .h and .cc file. Like to have a lofar_sharedptr.h.
** Can logical device use global parameterSet anywhere?
** Support SHARED LogicalDevices in the LDStartDaemon.
** GSB_Controller should be made fail save.
** GTM_ServiceBroker should support multihosts.
** GCFTasks are not scheduled right when an event is not handled.
