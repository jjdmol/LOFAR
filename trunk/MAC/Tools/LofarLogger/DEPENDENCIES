Compiler version:
compat-2.96 (special compiler for the RedHat 8.0 distribution; almost the same as 2.95 but extended with STL)
Because the 3.2 is already installed with RedHat 8.0 the gcc and g++ of the compat 
installation must be renamed (to for instance gcc296 and g++296).

EXTERNAL PACKAGES:
		
log4cplus-1.0
	Prepare build:
	> CC=gcc296 CXX=g++296 CXXFLAGS="-g -O2 -fno-rtti" sh ./configure --enable-threads=no
	- set '#define HAVE_SSTREAM 1' to comment
	- ignore compiler erros during compiling the 'test''s
	- ignore compiler error during installing the 'test's
