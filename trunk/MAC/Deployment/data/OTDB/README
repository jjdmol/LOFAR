!!!  IMPORTANT  !!!
The files in this directory depend on files in other directories!
Read the instructions below!


This directory contains the component files that need to be loaded in the OTDB.
Several components like the stations and the compute-nodes can be generated using
the '.base' files in the ../PVSS directory(!) with the command 'create_OTDB_files'.

All the '.comp' files and the generated '.gcomp' file can now be loaded manually
into a database using the OTB. To load all components into a database the 
load_all_comps.cc needs to be compiled first because we need the C++ layer of the
OTDB. To compile this program be sure you a installed OTDB package in
../../LOFAR/installed/gnu_debug. To compile the program type './compile'.

When 'create_OTDB_files' and 'compile' both succeeded you are ready to load all
components in this directory into a database, type 'load_components <databasename>'
e.g.:	load_components CDR
