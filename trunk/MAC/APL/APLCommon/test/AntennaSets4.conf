# AntennaSet.conf
#
# This file defines subsets of the (physical) antennafields that can be used
# in observations as 'the' antennafield.
#
# Since there are 3 different station layout each subset must be defined for 
# each stationtype (Core, Remote and Europe).
#
# A Subset is defined for specifying for each stationtypes for each RCU which
# input is used.
#
# Allowed values for the RCU input selection are:
#	H : HBA input
#	h : LBH input
#	l : LBL input
#	. : RCU not included
#
# To diminish the typing-work to syntax of an rcu definition is:
#   input-selector ::=  H | h | l | .
#	rcu_definition ::= number input-selector [ number inputselector ...]
#
# E.g. when on a station on all RCUs the HBA input must be used this can be defined as
#      192H  in stead of 192 'H' after each other.
#
# Or when all even RCUs should use LBL and all even RCUs shoud use LBH:
#	   96hl
#
# The total number of assigned RCUs MUST match the total number for each station:
#
# RCU counts	LBA		HBA
# Europe		192		192
# Remote		 96		 96
# Core			 96		 96
#
# Use inner half of the LBAs on Core and Remote
LBA_INNER LBA Europe	192h
LBA_INNER LBA Remote	96h
LBA_INNER LBA Europe	192h
LBA_INNER LBA Core		96h
