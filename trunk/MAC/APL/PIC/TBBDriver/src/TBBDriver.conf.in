# Configuration of the TBBDriver
#

#
# Specify the base index of the TBB board ethernet MAC address
# The TBB boards addresses will be numbered consecutively.
#
# Start from address: 10:FA:00:00:MAC_BASE:02
# TBBDriver.MAC_BASE=1

#
# Instead of specifying MAC_BASE, one can specify all MAC
# addresses explicitly as MAC_ADDR0..MAC_ADDR11
# In this case you must leave TBBDriver.MAC_BASE unspecified
#

TBBDriver.MAC_ADDR_0=10:FA:00:00:00:02
TBBDriver.MAC_ADDR_1=10:FA:00:00:01:02
TBBDriver.MAC_ADDR_2=10:FA:00:00:02:02
TBBDriver.MAC_ADDR_3=10:FA:00:00:03:02

# Ethernet interface on which to contact the TBB boards.
# This interface would normally be connected to the switch.

TBBDriver.IF_NAME=eth1

#
# Select LOOPBACK_MODE mode
#
# If LOOPBACK_MODE == 0, the WRITE is done first.
# In this mode the TBBDriver checks that what was
# written is correctly read back from the board. This can
# be used to check that the RSP board or the EPAStub
# functions correctly. Read results are not stored in
# the TBBDriver cache.
#
# If LOOPBACK_MODE == 1, the READ is done first.
# In this mode you can check with Ethereal that what was
# read from the RSP board or EPAStub is written back in
# the same way. This is used to check whether the TBBDriver
# stores the information at the correct location in its cache.
# Of course in this mode reads results are stored in the
# TBBDriver cache.

TBBDriver.LOOPBACK_MODE=0
