# Set ACCTestEnable to 1 to enable reading from file ACCTestFile

# Calibration is not implemented yet, but for testing purposes it is 
# possible to not run the calibration algorithm but pretend it has run. 
# This will result in zero weights being sent to clients.
# ACMProxy is a subtask that asks the RSPDriver to autocorrelate each second 
# another subband. The task is not used in normal operation; only use 
# this when really needed!
# The operational values are DisableCalibration=1 and DisableACMProxy=1
