// implementation combined with GCFTCPPort (thePortToClient) of the baseclass. 
// For communication with PA it uses the GCFTCPPort (thePortToPA) of the 
// baseclass too. Because the DataHolder’s are constructed with Blob’s and the 
// GCF port concept is based on GCFEvents, this class must also convert Blob’s 
// to GCFEvents and visa versa. 
// Note: Messages received from PA needed not be converted to Blob’s. 
// They will be first processed by the GPIPropertySet, which generates PI 
// messages for the PIA. These messages than has to be converted to Blob’s.
