Using: ServiceBroker

Using: PropertyAgent 
	- change the paramline 'mac.controller.pvss.cmdline' in PropertyAgent.conf to:
		-proj <projname> 
		(projname must be filled in with the project, which is configured for LOFAR)
Using: PropertyInterface
	- change the paramline 'mac.controller.pvss.cmdline' in PropertyInterface.conf to:
		-proj <projname> 
		(projname must be filled in with the project, which is configured for LOFAR)

Precondition:
- After installation of GCF go to install dir:
	> configurePVSSProj <projname>
- a PVSS project is running which is configured for GCF (see DEPENDENCIES)

Applications, which uses GCF/PAL, can place a file named customPrepPVSSDB.ctl in 
install dir of PropertyAgent, which executes the containing CTRL-script at startup.
(see example in MAC/TEST/GCF package).

These are continuous applications, which not end by itself. This can be done by CTRL-C.

If the containing packages must be build for the first time they must be build separate in the following order:
GCFCommon
TM
PAL
PALlight

Each package should be build with the following commands:
> bootstrap
> cd build/gnu_debug
> ../../lofarconf
> make install check
