Using: CEPEcho
			 CEPPing

Note: These exec's are part of a test run of Application3 from MAC/Test/GCF/MAC.
			They thus normaly will be stared automatically. But they also can be started
			by hand.
			
Precondition:
- The ServiceBroker, PropertAgent and PropertyInterface of GCF are running (see README in GCF)
- be sure mac.log_prop is placed in ../etc and the CEPEcho and CEPPing are placed in the same dir as the Application3
- If these exec's are started by hand (and thus not by Application3 from MAC/Test/GCF/MAC) 
	load DPType's and DP's before starting them by: PVSS00api -in MAC/Test/GCF/MAC/src/gcftesttypes.dpl -proj <proj>
