#
# Each task is a block like this:
#
# [TaskName]
#
# For each task a specification is given of how to
# connect a task's SAP's to the remote tasks SPP like this:
#
# [TaskName]
# local_SAP_port_name = remote_task_name:remote_SPP_port_name
#
# Connections are initiated by the SAP and accepted
# by the SPP. Although establishing the connection
# is directional from SAP to SPP, the data transport
# via the ports is bidirectional.
#

#
# Connect SAP port 'client' of task 'PING' to
# SPP port 'server' of task 'ECHO'
