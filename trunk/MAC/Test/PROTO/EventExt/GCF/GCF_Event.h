/**
 * This struct is the base event data container to exchange messages between two 
 * tasks. 
 * Application tasks will have to define their own protocol by specifying the 
 * contents of events that are exchanged between tasks. Creating sub class from 
 * GCFEvent creates application (tasks) specific events. All GCFEvent sub 
 * classes are generally the same except for the parameters that make the event 
 * unique. A protocol is a collection of events where each event has a specific 
 * direction (IN/OUT). To create a new protocol a protocol specification file 
 * must be created (with extension '.prot'). The autogen utility is then used to 
 * convert this specification file into a header file containing GCFEvent sub 
 * class definitions. 
 * The protocol specification consists of a list of the possible events in the 
 * protocol each with its own parameters (or no parameters) and with the 
 * direction in which the event can be sent. The autogen utility is used to 
 * generate a header file from this definition using a template for the header 
 * file and the nested key-value pairs from the specification file. This header 
 * file contains definitions of GCFEvent sub classes, one for each event.
