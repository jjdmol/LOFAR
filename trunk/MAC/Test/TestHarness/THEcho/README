The THEcho application is a server for the THEcho and THEchoRouting protocols.
It is also a client for the THEchoRouting protocol. Pings and echos of the
THEcho protocol are exchanged on the same bi-directional connection. Pings of 
the THEchoRouting protocol are sent to the server port of the THEcho application
and it replies by sending the echo using the client connection.

The THEchoTest application can be used to test the THEcho application.
