   This class defines the transport mechanism between data holders
   that have been connected using a TH_ShMem object. This can
   only be done when both data holders reside within the same address
   space.  It uses memcpy to transport the data.

   It uses a variable in shared memory to communicate the address in
   shared memory to copy the data from. The address of this variable
   has to be communicated once to the receiver. For this another
   transport mechanism must be used.
