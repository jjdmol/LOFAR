LCS/Transport: Version 2.0, date: 2005/06/17
============================================

This is the second major release of the LCS/Transport library. The interface
has undergone some major changes. See Enhancement Request ER-231 for details.
Connections between two DataHolder objects are now made using a Connection
object. Hence, DataHolders and TransportHolder can now be used independently.

The build process has changed as well. The Transport library should now be
built against an installed version of the Common library. (Ref. ER-270 and
ER-273).


The following Enhancement Requests have been implemented
--------------------------------------------------------

ER 231 : Transport             : Change DH/Transport/TH relationship 

         Change the transport library in such a way DataHolders and
         TransportHolders can be used independently. Plus remove all unused
         functionality from the interfaces of all classes.

ER 270 : Build environment     : Modify build process to use installed
                                 packages

         The current build process uses (locally) built packages and does some
         trickery to derive package dependencies. Although this approach works
         in practice, it causes unwanted build dependencies between
         packages. Furthermore, the current design does not allow running a
         'make distcheck', which is a prerequisite for building a package
         distribution (e.g. tarball or rpm).

ER 273 : Build environment     : Change from lofar_PACKAGE to lofar_INTERNAL

         Instead of lofar_PACKAGE, lofar_INTERNAL should be used in the
         configure.in files. This is in preparation of making distributable
         packages.


The following Problem Reports have been fixed
---------------------------------------------

PR 100 : LOFAR SW development  : Neither config.h nor lofar_config.h should
                                 be included in header files

         Inclusion of either config.h or lofar_config.h in a distributed
         header file is problematic, because the config files themselves
         cannot be distributed; they contain system specific definitions. It
         is therefore unwise to include either of these files in a header
         file.

         Note: This Problem Report is closely related to Enhancement Request
               ER 229.

PR 154 : Transport             : Connection.read may not be repeated 

         In branch ER231_development a Connection class is introduced. When
         working with NonBlocking TH's the read() function may not be called
         repeatedly Therefor you can not use the function as a poll mechanism
         which is often used in servers.  The read() call must be implemented
         like the recvNonBocking() function in the TH_Socket of that branch.

PR 159 : Transport             : adjustment for BlueGene 

         #ifndef HAVE_BGL added for compiling on BlueGene

PR 163 : Transport             : Corba stuff is antiquated: remove 

         The Corba stuff is very out-of-date. It will most certainly not build
         anymore. Hence the code should be moved to the CVS attic.
