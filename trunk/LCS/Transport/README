LCS/Transport package
=====================

The Transport package implements basic data transport functionality, mostly
oriented towards point-to-point connections. Data is transported between
DataHolder objects, which may exist in different processes and on different
machines in a network. The user can specialise the DataHolder class to
represent his/her own required data format. A variety of transport mechanisms 
is provided through TransportHolder specialisations.

The Transport library provides three basic types of classes:

DataHolder        Base class responsible for holding and managing access to
		  data.

TransportHolders  These classes implement a data transport mechanism, for
                  instance transport via sockets in TH_Socket or via MPI in
                  TH_MPI.

Connections       A Connection creates the link between DataHolder and
                  TransportHolder. By creating a Connecion object between
	          DataHolders with a certain TransportHolder the data can be
                  transported. It also provides the interface to initiate
                  Transportation.
