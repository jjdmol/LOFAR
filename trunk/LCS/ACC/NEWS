LCS/ACC: Version 2.1, date: 2006/02/01
======================================

In preparation of making package distributable as rpm package, all header
files that must be installed have been moved from the `src' directory to the
`inclucde/<package>' directory (ref. BugID #396).

Furthermore, some changes to the build environment require the use of
autoconf_share 2.4 (or later). 


The following BugIDs have been resolved
---------------------------------------

# 466 : make ACC RPM installable
        All subpackages of ACC are made installable by rpm.

# 546 : Add 'not_supported' return value to ACC commands
        Implemented tribool's for the Process commands. The commands on the
        application side are left unchanged and still return a bool.



LCS/ACC: Version 2.0, date: 2005/07/08
======================================

Version 2.0 has two major changes:
[1] The directory structure is changed
[2] The ParameterSet class is extended (ER285).

[1] ACC is split into 4 subpackages
-----------------------------------
APS : Application ParameterSet
APS contains the functionality of the ParametersSet. 

ALC : Application Lifecycle Control
Library that supports the use of the Application Control protocol.

PLC : Proces Lifecycle Control
Library that supports the use of the Process Control protocol.

ACCbin : Executables of ACC.
Contains the programs ACDaemon and ApplController.

[2] The ParameterSet was changed according to ER285
---------------------------------------------------
The group of parameter related classes is reduced to one class the ParameterSet.
This class is extended with functions to support most of the basic types of 
LOFAR like uint16, int16, uint32, etc. 
The function getInt became obsolete, use getInt32 instead.
The ParameterSet is also extended with functions to get vectors of variables:
getUint16Vector, getInt16Vector, etc.



LCS/ACC: Version 1.1, date: 2005/06/17
======================================

Version 1.1 of LCS/ACC package is the first "official" release. The main
differences with the first "unofficial" release (version 1.0) are related to
the changed interface of the LCS/Transport package. No functionality has been
added. 

The build process has changed as well. The ACC library should now be built
against an installed version of the Common and Transport
libraries. (Ref. ER-270 and ER-273).


The following Enhancement Requests have been implemented
--------------------------------------------------------

ER 231 : Transport             : Change DH/Transport/TH relationship 

         Change the transport library in such a way DataHolders and
         TransportHolders can be used independently. Plus remove all unused
         functionality from the interfaces of all classes.

ER 242 : Demo                  : Station Correlator development 

         Added functionality to start MPI programs using mpirun.

ER 264 : ACC                   : ApplController should preserve commandnr 

         The sendExecutionResult function must get an extra parameter being
         the original commandnr. When sending a couple of commands and look at
         the results afterwards may perhaps result in wrong commandnr reported
         back.

ER 273 : Build environment     : Change from lofar_PACKAGE to lofar_INTERNAL

         Instead of lofar_PACKAGE, lofar_INTERNAL should be used in the
         configure.in files. This is in preparation of making distributable
         packages.


The following Problem Reports have been fixed
---------------------------------------------

PR 100 : LOFAR SW development  : Neither config.h nor lofar_config.h should
                                 be included in header files

         Inclusion of either config.h or lofar_config.h in a distributed
         header file is problematic, because the config files themselves
         cannot be distributed; they contain system specific definitions. It
         is therefore unwise to include either of these files in a header
         file.

         Note: This Problem Report is closely related to Enhancement Request
               ER 229.
