LCS/Tools package
=================

The LCS/Tools contains a collection of basic tools that can help the developer
doing his day to day tasks. Contrary to all other LOFAR packages, this package
does NOT produce a library. Instead, it is a collection of useful executables,
both binaries and scripts.

The current release contains the following useful executables:

LimitExec      : Limit the execution time of a program to a maximum.
makePackage.py : Create a new LOFAR package.
                 The script will create a skeleton configure.in file, a src and
                 test directory containing a skeleton Makefile.am; the new
                 package will be added to the lofarconf.in file.
makeClass.py   : Create a skeleton for a new class. 
                 The script produces a .h and .cc file. Furthermore, it adds
                 entries for these files in the Makefile.am
makeTest.py    : Create a skeleton for a test program.
                 The script will generate a .cc file, a .sh file, a .in and a
                 .out file
