#ifdef __DEPRECATED
#warning Making LOFAR symbols available in the global namespace is \
deprecated. Please change your code as follows: 1) all declarations in the \
header files should be put in the namespace LOFAR; 2) all implementations in \
the source files should either be put in the namespace LOFAR, or should \
contain the using directive "using namespace LOFAR". To disable this warning \
use -Wno-deprecated.
