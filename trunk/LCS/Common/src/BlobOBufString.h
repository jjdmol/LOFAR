// This class is the BlobOBuffer that makes use of a string object.
// The string can be static or dynamic. A static string has a fixed
// length and cannot grow. A dynamic string can grow as needed.
//
// The class is templated. However, the template parameter can only be
// a char or unsigned char. The constructor checks if sizeof(T)==1.
// The class is meant to be used as BlobOBufString<uchar> to be able to
// generate a blob in a string<uchar> for use in the PL classes and DTL.
