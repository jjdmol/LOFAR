LCS/databases/PL
================

The Persistence Layer bridges the gap between the objected-oriented C++ world
and the relational database world.

Detailed information about the PL can be found in the "LOFAR Persistence Layer
- User Manual", LOFAR-ASTRON-MAN-007.

Several scripts are available in the `scripts' directory that can help
generating the required "stub" code for making an object persistent.


The package is divided into a number of directories, containing the following:

- src        : the source files needed to create the package library.
- test       : a number of test programs used for regression tests.
- demo       : a number of programs demonstrating how to use the PL
- include    : header files, most of which declare the public interface.
- scripts    : useful scripts for generating the required "stub" code for
               making an object persistent.
