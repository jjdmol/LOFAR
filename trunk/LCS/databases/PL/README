LCS/databases/PL
================

The Persistence Layer bridges the gap between the objected-oriented C++ world
and the relational database world.

Several scripts are available in the LCS/databases/PLGEN directory that can
help generating the required "stub" code for making an object persistent.

Detailed information about the PL can be found in the "LOFAR Persistence Layer
- User Manual".
