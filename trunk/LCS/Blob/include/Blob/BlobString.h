  // A BlobString object can hold a blob (binary large object).
  // Blobs are created by the BlobOStream class and read back by BlobIStream.
  // An BlobOBufString object has to be used to make a BlobString object
  // available for BlobOStream.
  // The main purpose of BlobString is the hide the way of allocating memory
  // for the blob. A BlobStringType object defines the way of allocation.
  //
  // The main goal is the transparent use of blobs in the TransportHolder
  // objects in CEPFrame.

  //  <li> It can be a char* buffer in shared memory for TH_ShMem.
  //  <li> It can be a char* buffer on the heap for, say, TH_Mem or TH_MPI.
  //  <li> It can be a string<uchar> for TH_PL.
  // </ol>
  // Normally the buffer will expand as needed. However, it is possible to
  // tell that the buffer has a fixed size. In such a case an exception is
  // thrown if the buffer is too small.
  // Please note that a BlobOBufNull object can be used to find the exact
  // length of a blob before allocating the BlobString.
