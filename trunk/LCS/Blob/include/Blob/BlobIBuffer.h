  // BlobIBuffer is the abstract base class for the source of a
  // BlobIStream object. In this way the source of a BlobIStream
  // can be chosen as needed. Currently three source types are possible:
  // <ul>
  // <li> BlobIBufStream uses an istream as the source. It is mainly
  //      meant to read blobs from a file, socket, etc.
  // <li> BlobIBufChar uses a plain C-array as the source. Its mainly used
  //      as a helper class, but can also be used in itself.
  // <li> BlobIBufVector<T> uses a vector<T> (where T is char or uchar)
  //      as the source.
  //      It uses BlobIBufChar to do the actual work.
  // <li> BlobIBufString uses a BlobString as the source.
  //      It uses BlobIBufChar to do the actual work.
  //      It is mainly meant for reading blobs stored using the LCS
  //      Persistency Layer.
  // </ul>
