LCS/AMC/AMCImpl: Version 1.0 patch 1, date: 2005/09/27
======================================================

The following BugIDs have been resolved:
---------------------------------------

# 382 : Connection loss to AMCserver can not be detected or acted upon in
        client.

        ConverterServer would throw an AssertError when the client had
        died. This has now been fixed; a ServerError is thrown instead, which
        is caught in the main event loop.


LCS/AMC/AMCImpl: Version 1.0, date: 2005/07/04
