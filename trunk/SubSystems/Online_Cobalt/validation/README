Cobalt system validation
------------------------------

To validate a Cobalt node, do the following:

1. Obtain sudo or root privileges, f.e. run:
     sudo true
2. Run the validation sequence:
     ./validate [subsystem]
     subsystem = cluster | cobalt | system 
3. Verify that all tests passed.

System validation sequence
------------------------------

The system validation runs all tests in `./tests' in their own directory.
A test is an executable ending in `.test', the output of which will be put
in `.test.log'. For tests ending in `.root.test', elevated privileges are
needed. Such tests are run using `sudo -n'.

The cluster validations are not run by default for they influence a possible
running observation. To run the cluster validation (ensure a available 
cluster!!) : ./validate cluster
